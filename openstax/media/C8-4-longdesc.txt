The diagram illustrates the five elements of social media literacy in a downward arrow as follows. Attention: How aware are you about who and what is around you? How focused are you on information or people? Participation: How are you responding, voting, providing information, generating content? Collaboration: In what ways are you working with others through a technology or medium? For what purpose and outcomes are you cooperating? Are there times when you avoid cooperation? Network Awareness: What communities are you joining through your online interactions? Whom are you inviting (intentionally or unintentionally) to learn about you and possibly influence you? What ideas, information, influence, and emotions are you giving and taking from these extended networks? Critical Consumption: From what sources are messages and information flowing to you? How reliable and factual are those sources? What are their motivations and goals in saying or doing certain things?
