The vertical axis of the graph represents three different types of course areas or activities that they make the most use of problem solving skills: Math or quantitative classes, computer or technical classes, social science classes, and real-life situations. The horizontal axis of the graph ranges from 0 to 50 percent, in increments of 10 percent. The data plotted on the graph is as follows: Math or quantitative classes, 37 percent; computer or technical classes, 14 percent; social science classes, 7 percent; real-life situations, 41 percent. All values are approximated.
