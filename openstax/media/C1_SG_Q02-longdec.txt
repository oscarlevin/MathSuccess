The vertical axis of the graph represents the responses of students. The horizontal axis of the graph represents percentage ranging from 0 to 40, in increments of 10. The data plotted in the graph is as follows: I will likely persevere until I figure it out, 35 percent; I will likely try to solve the problem, but if it is really difficult, I simply move on to something else, 19 percent; I will likely ask my friends, guardians, or parents for advice, 20 percent; I will likely seek help from resources on campus, 26 percent. All values are approximated.
