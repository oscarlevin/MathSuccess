The items in the checklist for study and test success of students are numbered from 1 through 10 as follows.

1. Read all assigned lessons: Prepare to make the most of your class time with instructors and other students.
2. Attend all classes: You cannot interact with the material and the others in your class if you are not there.
3. Take notes during each class: Even if you are uncertain about the lesson&#8217;s topics or importance, take notes so that you remember what was covered.
4. Review and improve notes: Do this within 24 hours. Memory studies show that we have to work with information quickly or we&#8217;ll start to forget it.
5. Study regularly: Work at least one hour per week for every hour in class; repetition and frequency are important factors for studying.
6. Re-read significant text passages: This helps build your memory and better prepares you for class and tests.
7. Review with classmates: You each receive the benefit of the other&#8217;s perspective on the material.
8. Take authentic practice tests: Use study guides or sample tests to gauge what you really know and what you need to work on.
9. Practice timed writing: Timing is essential in most test situations. Practice can help you manage the pressure and ensure you use the time effectively.
10. Get enough sleep every night: Sleep impacts memory, performance, energy, and our ability to handle stress and the unexpected (both common in test situations).
