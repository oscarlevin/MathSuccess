The vertical axis of the bar graph represents the responses for six different applications. The horizontal axis of the graph represents the percentage from 0 to 40 percent, in increments of 10. The data plotted on the graph are as follows. I don&#39;t use any type of planner or app, 13 percent; I use another app or system, 5 percent; I use the calendar in my learning management system, 4 percent; I use a paper/notebook planner, 30 percent; I use the calendar on my phone, 13 percent; I use Google calendar, 33 percent.
