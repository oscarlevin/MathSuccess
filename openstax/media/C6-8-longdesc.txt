The photo on the left shows a neat and properly arranged study table. A computer sits on the right of the table with shelves on the left containing books and other items. A potted plant appears at the extreme left of the table and sticky notes and post-its appearing on the front. The photo on the right shows a messy table full of books and other stationery items, all placed out of order. There are many books lying in the front of the table, with a water bottle, a spray bottle, a plastic bag, keys, and other items between them.
