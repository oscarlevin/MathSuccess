The engraving shows a detailed view of the interior of The School of Athens by Raphael. The two main figures in the work, Plato and Aristotle appear directly under the archway. An elderly Plato stands at the left, pointing his finger to the sky. Beside him is his student Aristotle, who reaches his right arm directly out toward the viewer. Each man holds a copy of their books in their left hand. To the left of Plato is Socrates cloaked in an olive mantle arguing in a group that includes Chrysippus, Xenophon, Aeschines, and Alcibiades. Facing the venerable Venetian scientist Zeno is Epicurus, crowned with grape leaves. In the foreground, Pythagoras sits with a book and an inkwell, also surrounded by students. The mournful Heraclitus sits beside them with his head resting on his arm. Further to the right, calmly reclining on the stairs is Diogenes. Mirroring Pythagoras&#8217; position on the other side, Euclid is bent over demonstrating something with a compass. His young students eagerly try to grasp the lessons he&#8217;s teaching them. The great mathematician and astronomer Ptolemy is right next to Euclid, with his back to the viewer. Wearing a yellow robe, he holds a terrestrial globe in his hand.
