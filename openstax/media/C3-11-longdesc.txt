The seven ways to stay motivated and achieve important goals are listed as follows:

1. Increase personal responsibility - Adopt the mindset that you are the only person responsible for your goals. Hindrances and roadblocks may appear along the way, but you are responsible for navigating around them and overcoming them. Take control of the journey! Issues are not other people&#8217;s problems. They are for you to solve.
2. Reward yourself for completing the task &#8211; We are all motivated by rewards. Use this to your advantage and give yourself rewards for a job well done. 
3. Make certain they are your goals &#8211; Again, your motivation level is not as high if the end result is not something you want to achieve.
4. Visualize the results &#8211;Keeping in mind the benefits and visualizing the end results of each goal is extremely effective in keeping motivated.
5. Break the goal down into manageable tasks &#8211; As with any task, accomplishing the whole is easier when each part is tackled individually.
6. Tap into other people&#39;s energy- Surround yourself with other people that are motivated. As humans, we are social creatures, which means our moods and emotions can be influenced by others. If you are around other positive people that all work toward achieving their own goals, their energy can become infectious.
7. Remind yourself why you set the goal- This last item is of the utmost importance, especially for long term goals. Sometimes it is too easy to become mired in the drudgery of a difficult task and forget why you are doing something in the first place. Reminding yourself of the end goal helps reinforce everything you do that works toward your goal.
