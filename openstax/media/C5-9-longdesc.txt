The chart shows the academic essay elements as &#8220;Topic,&#8221; &#8220;Thesis,&#8221; &#8220;Supporting Details,&#8221; and &#8220;Conclusion.&#8221; The major points to be considered under each element are as follows. Topic: &#8220;Establishes context,&#8221; &#8220;Limits scope of essay,&#8221; and &#8220;Introduces Issue/Problem.&#8221; Thesis: &#8220;Central argument or point of paper,&#8221; &#8220;Arrives early in paper &#8211; usually toward end of first paragraph (maybe a bit later in longer papers),&#8221; &#8220;Focused, clear, and specific,&#8221; and &#8220;Reflects writer&#8217;s position on the topic/issue.&#8221; Supporting Detail Paragraphs: &#8220;Each paragraph has a specific topic,&#8221; &#8220;Clarify, &#8220;explain, illustrate, expand on topic,&#8221; and &#8220;Provide EVIDENCE &#8211; quotes, data, references (cite everything properly!).&#8221; Conclusion: &#8220;Tie back to intro/thesis,&#8221; &#8220;Show how details supported the argument,&#8221; &#8220;Why is it important,&#8221; and &#8220;Point to implications/outcomes, but don&#8217;t introduce entirely new ideas.&#8221;

A footnote reads, &#8220;Use the structure, but don&#8217;t follow it too rigidly. The most important pieces are a strong thesis and good evidence to back it up. The conclusion should not just summarize &#8211; take it a little further.&#8221;
