The image of the food circle shows the plate is divided into four sections for "Fruits," "Grains," "Protein," and "Vegetables." The section of the plate consuming vegetables is the largest, followed by grains, protein, and fruits. The plate is accompanied by a fork and a smaller circle representing "Dairy." A text at the bottom reads, "Choose My Plate dot gov."
