&#8220;Now we (The word &#8220;we&#8221; is noted as &#8220;everybody here in U S and world&#8221;) are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation (The word &#8220;nation&#8221; is noted as &#8220;which&#8221;), or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We (The word &#8220;we&#8221; is noted as &#8220;all of us&#8221;) have come to dedicate a portion (The word &#8220;portion&#8221; is noted as &#8220;part&#8221;) of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives (The words &#8220;their lives&#8221; is noted as &#8220;died&#8221;) that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper (The word &#8220;fitting and proper&#8221; is noted as &#8220;we should&#8221;) that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate - we cannot consecrate - we cannot hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. (The previous two lines are highlighted) The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished (The word &#8220;unfinished&#8221; is noted as &#8220;battle not finished&#8221;) work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth (The word &#8220;birth&#8221; is noted as &#8220;born&#8221;) of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth (The word &#8220;earth&#8221; is noted as &#8220;here&#8221;).&#8221; Address ends. A handwritten text at the end reads, &#8220;Really important!&#8221;
