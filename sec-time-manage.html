</ul></article> <div class="para" id="p-409">You may find that time management in college is very different from anything you have experienced previously. For high school students, almost all school time is managed by educators and parents. In many cases, even after-school time may be set by scheduled activities (such as athletics) and by nightly homework that is due the next day.In the workplace, the situation is not very different, with activities and time on task being monitored by the company and its management. See the table below for a comparison of high school students and college students with regard to time and task management.</div> <figure class="table table-like" id="m00007-ch02tab02"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.4.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">

</table></div></figure> <div class="para" id="p-416">In college, there is a significant difference because a great deal of time management is left up to you. While it is true that there are assignment due dates and organized classroom activities, learning at the college level requires more than just the simple completion of work. As an example of how this works, think about an assignment that involves giving a classroom presentation. To complete the assignment, you are given time to research and reflect on the information found. As a part of the assignment, you must reach your own conclusions and determine which information that you have found is best suited for the presentation. While the date of the actual presentation and how long it will last are usually determined by the instructor, how much time you spend gathering information, the sources you use, and how you use them are left to you.</div></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-53"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">You Have Lots of Time to Manage.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-417">For college-level learning, this approach is important enough that you can expect to spend much more time on learning activities outside the classroom than you will in the classroom. In fact, the estimated time you should spend will be at least two hours of outside learning for every one hour of lecture. Some weeks may be more intense, depending on the time of the semester and the courses you are taking. If those hours are multiplied over several courses in a given session, you can see how there is a significant amount of time to manage. Unfortunately, many students do not always take this into consideration, and they spend far less time than is needed to be successful. The results of poor time management are often a shock to them.</div> <div class="para" id="p-418"><em class="emphasis">“In college, as an active participant in your own education, what you do and when you do it is largely determined by you.”</em></div></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-54"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Procrastination.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-419">We all know about procrastination, the act of delaying some task that needs to be completed, because most of us have procrastinated at some point in our lives. For most people, a little procrastination is not a cause for great concern. But there are situations where procrastination can become a serious problem with a lot of risk. These include when it becomes a chronic habit, when there are a number of tasks to complete and little time, or when the task being avoided is very important. In college, students who procrastinate often report that they feel more stress and are more likely to do poorly than those who have learned to manage their time and their projects effectively.</div> <div class="para" id="p-420">Because we all procrastinate from time to time, we usually do not give it much thought, let alone think about its causes or effects. Ironically, many of the psychological reasons for why we avoid a given task also keep us from using critical thinking to understand why procrastination can be extremely detrimental, and in some cases difficult to overcome.</div> <div class="para" id="p-421">To succeed at time management, you must understand some of the hurdles that may stand in your way. Procrastination is often one of the biggest. What follows is an overview of procrastination with a few suggestions on how to avoid it.</div></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-55"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">The Reasons Behind Procrastination.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-422">There are several reasons we procrastinate, and a few of them may be surprising. On the surface we often tell ourselves it is because the task is something we do not want to do, or we make excuses that there are other things more important to do first. In some cases this may be true, but there can be other contributors to procrastination that have their roots in our physical well-being or our own psychological motivations.</div> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-56"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Lack of Energy.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-423">Sometimes we just do not feel up to a certain task. It might be due to discomfort, an illness, or just a lack of energy. If this is the case, it is important to identify the cause and remedy the situation. It could be something as simple as a lack of sleep or improper diet. Regardless, if a lack of energy is continually causing you to procrastinate to the point where you are beginning to feel stress over not getting things done, you should definitely assess the situation and address it.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-57"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Lack of Focus.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-424">Much like having low physical energy, a lack of mental focus can be a cause of procrastination. This can be due to mental fatigue, being disorganized, or allowing yourself to be distracted by other things. Again, like low physical energy, this is something that may have farther-reaching effects in your life that go beyond the act of simply avoiding a task. If it is something that is recurring, you should properly assess the situation.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-58"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Fear of Failure.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-425">This cause of procrastination is not one that many people are aware of, especially if they are the person avoiding tasks because of it. To put it in simple words, it is a bit of trickery we play on ourselves by avoiding a situation that makes us psychologically uncomfortable. Even though they may not be consciously aware of it, the person facing the task is afraid that they cannot do it or will not be able to do it well. If they fail at the task, it will make them appear incompetent to others or even to themselves. Where the self-trickery comes in is by avoiding the task. In the person’s mind, they can rationalize that the reason they failed at the task was because they ran out of time to complete it, not that they were incapable of doing it in the first place.</div> <div class="para" id="p-426">It is important to note that a fear of failure may not have anything to do with the actual ability of the person suffering from it. They could be quite capable of doing the task and performing well, but it is the fear that holds them back.</div> </section></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-59"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">The Effects of Procrastination.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-427">In addition to the causes of procrastination, you must also consider what effects it can have. Again, many of these effects are obvious and commonly understood, but some may not be so obvious and may cause other issues.</div> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-60"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Loss of Time.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-428">The loss of time as an effect of procrastination is the easiest to identify since the act of avoiding a task comes down to not using time wisely. Procrastination can be thought of as using the time you have to complete a task in ways that do not accomplish what needs to be done.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-61"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Loss of Goals.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-429">Another of the more obvious potentially adverse effects of procrastination is the loss of goals. Completing a task leads to achieving a goal. These can be large or small (e.g., from doing well on an assignment to being hired for a good job). Without goals you might do more than delay work on a task—you may not complete it at all. The risk for the loss of goals is something that is very impactful.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-62"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Loss of Self-Esteem.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-430">Often, when we procrastinate we become frustrated and disappointed in ourselves for not getting important tasks completed. If this continues to happen, we can begin to develop a low opinion of ourselves and our own abilities. We begin to suffer from low self-esteem and might even begin to feel like there is something wrong with us. This can lead to other increasingly negative mental factors such as anger and depression. As you can see, it is important for our own well-being to avoid this kind of procrastination effect.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-63"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Stress.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-431">Procrastination causes stress and anxiety, which may seem odd since the act of procrastination is often about avoiding a task we think will be stressful in itself! Anyone who has noticed that nagging feeling when they know there is something else they should be doing is familiar with this.</div> <div class="para" id="p-432">On the other hand, some students see that kind of stress as a boost of mental urgency. They put off a task until they feel that surge of motivation. While this may have worked in the past, they quickly learn that procrastinating when it comes to college work almost always includes an underestimation of the tasks to be completed— sometimes with disastrous results.</div></section></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-64"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Strategies for Psyching Ourselves Out and Managing Procrastination.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-433">Now that you understand a few of the major problems procrastination can produce, let’s look at methods to manage procrastination and get you on to completing the tasks, no matter how unpleasant you think they might be.</div> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-65"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Get Organized.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-434">Much of this chapter is dedicated to defining and explaining the nature of time management. The most effective way to combat procrastination is to use time and project management strategies such as schedules, goal setting, and other techniques to get tasks accomplished in a timely manner.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-66"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Put Aside Distractions.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-435">Several of the methods discussed in this chapter deal specifically with distractions. Distractions are time-killers and are the primary way people procrastinate. It is too easy to just play a video game a little while longer, check out social media, or finish watching a movie when we are avoiding a task. Putting aside distractions is one of the primary functions of setting priorities.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-67"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Reward Yourself.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-436">Rewarding yourself for the completion of tasks or meeting goals is a good way to avoid procrastination. An example of this would be rewarding yourself with the time to watch a movie you would enjoy a<em class="emphasis">fter</em> you have finished the things you need to do, rather than using the movie to keep yourself from getting things done.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-68"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Be Accountable.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-437">A strong motivational tool is to hold ourselves accountable by telling someone else we are going to do something and when we are going to do it. This may not seem like it would be very effective, but on a psychological level we feel more compelled to do something if we tell someone else. It may be related to our need for approval from others, or it might just serve to set a level of commitment. Either way, it can help us stay on task and avoid procrastination—especially if we take our accountability to another person seriously enough to warrant contacting that person and apologizing for not doing what we said we were going to do.</div></section></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-69"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">How to Manage Time.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-438">The simplest way to manage your time is to accurately plan for how much time it will take to do each task, and then set aside that amount of time. How you divide the time is up to you. If it is going to take you five hours to study for a final exam, you can plan to spread it over five days, with an hour each night, or you can plan on two hours one night and three hours the next. What you would not want to do is plan on studying only a few hours the night before the exam and find that you fell very short on the time you estimated you would need. If that were to happen, you would have run out of time before finishing, with no way to go back and change your decision. In this kind of situation, you might even be tempted to “pull an all-nighter,” which is a phrase that has been used among college students for decades. In essence it means going without sleep for the entire night and using that time to finish an assignment. While this method of trying to make up for poor planning is common enough to have a name, rarely does it produce the best work.</div> <div class="para" id="p-439">While you can find all sorts of estimates online as to how long a certain task may take, it is important to know these are only averages. People read at different speeds, people write at different speeds, and those numbers even change for each individual depending on the environment.</div> <div class="para" id="p-440">If you are trying to read in surroundings that have distractions (e.g., conversations, phone calls, etc.), reading 10 pages can take you a lot longer than if you are reading in a quiet area. By the same token, you may be reading in a quiet environment (e.g., in bed after everyone in the house has gone to sleep), but if you are tired, your attention and retention may not be what it would be if you were refreshed.</div> <div class="para" id="p-441">In essence, the only way you are going to be able to manage your time accurately is to know yourself and to know how long it takes you to do each task. But where to begin?</div></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-70"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">How to Prioritize.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-442">The enemy of good prioritization is panic, or at least making decisions based on strictly emotional reactions. It can be all too easy to immediately respond to a problem as soon as it pops up without thinking of the consequences of your reaction and how it might impact other priorities. It is very natural for us to want to remove a stressful situation as soon as we can. We want the adverse emotions out of the way as quickly as possible. But when it comes to juggling multiple problems or tasks to complete, prioritizing them first may mean the difference between completing everything satisfactorily and completing nothing at all.</div> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-71"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Make Certain You Understand the Requirements of Each Task.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-443">One of the best ways to make good decisions about the prioritization of tasks is to understand the requirements of each. If you have multiple assignments to complete and you assume one of those assignments will only take an hour, you may decide to put it off until the others are finished. Your assumption could be disastrous if you find, once you begin the assignment, that there are several extra components that you did not account for and the time to complete will be four times as long as you estimated. Or, one of the assignments may be dependent on the results of another—like participating in a study and then writing a report on the results. If you are not aware that one assignment depends upon the completion of the other before you begin, you could inadvertently do the assignments out of order and have to start over. Because of situations like this, it is critically important to understand exactly what needs to be done to complete a task before you determine its priority.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-72"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Make Decisions on Importance, Impact on Other Priorities, and Urgency.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-444">After you are aware of the requirements for each task, you can then decide your priorities based on the importance of the task and what things need to be finished in which order.</div> <div class="para" id="p-445">To summarize: <em class="emphasis">the key components to prioritization are making certain you understand each task and making decisions based on importance, impact, and urgency.</em>
</div> </section></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-73"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Who Is Driving Your Tasks?</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-446">Another thing to keep in mind when approaching time management is that while you may have greater autonomy in managing your own time, many of your tasks are being driven by a number of different individuals. These individuals are not only unaware of the other things you need to do, but they often also have goals that are in conflict with your other tasks. This means that different instructors, your manager at work, or even your friends may be trying to assert their needs into your priorities. An example of this might be a boss who would like for you to work a few hours of overtime, but you were planning on using that time to do research for a paper.</div> <div class="para" id="p-447">Just like assessing the requirements and needs for each priority, doing the same with how others may be influencing your available time can be an important part of time management. In some cases, keeping others informed about your priorities may help avert possible conflicts (e.g., letting your boss know you will need time on a certain evening to study, letting your friends know you plan to do a journal project on Saturday but can do something on Sunday, etc.).</div> <div class="para" id="p-448">It will be important to be aware of how others can drive your priorities and for you to listen to your own good judgment. In essence, time management in college is as much about managing all the elements of your life as it is about managing time for class and to complete assignments.</div></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-74"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Making the Tough Decision When It Is Needed.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-449">Occasionally, regardless of how much you have planned or how well you have managed your time, events arise where it becomes almost impossible to accomplish everything you need to by the time required. While this is very unfortunate, it simply cannot be helped. As the saying goes, “things happen.”</div> <div class="para" id="p-450">Finding yourself in this kind of situation is when prioritization becomes most important. You may find yourself in the uncomfortable position of only being able to complete one task or another in the time given. When this occurs with college assignments, the dilemma can be extremely stressful, but it is important to not feel overwhelmed by the anxiety of the situation so that you can make a carefully calculated decision based on the value and impact of your choice.</div> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-75"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">What Do You Do When Faced with Priority Conflicts?</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-451">As an illustration, imagine a situation where you think you can only complete one of two assignments that are both important and urgent, and you must make a choice of which one you will finish and which one you will not. This is when it becomes critical to understand all the factors involved. While it may seem that whichever assignment is worth the most points to your grade is how you make the choice, there are actually a number of other attributes that can influence your decision in order to make the most of a bad situation. For example, one of the assignments may only be worth a minimal number of points toward your total grade, but it may be foundational to the rest of the course. Not finishing it, or finishing it late, may put other future assignments in jeopardy as well. Or the instructor for one of the courses might have a “late assignment” policy that is more forgiving—something that would allow you to turn in the work a little late without too much of a penalty.</div> <div class="para" id="p-452">If you find yourself in a similar predicament, the first step is to try to find a way to get everything finished, regardless of the challenges. If that simply cannot happen, the next immediate step would be to communicate with your instructors to let them know about the situation. They may be able to help you decide on a course of action, or they may have options you had not thought of. Only then can you make the choices about prioritizing in a tough situation.</div> <div class="para" id="p-453">The key here is to make certain you are aware of and understand all the ramifications to help make the best decision when the situation dictates you make a hard choice among priorities.</div></section></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-76"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Completing the Tasks.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-454">Another important part of time management is to develop approaches that will help you complete tasks in a manner that is efficient and works for you. Most of this comes down to a little planning and being as informed about the specifics of each task as you can be.</div> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-77"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Knowing How You Will Get It Done.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-455">After you have a clear understanding of what needs to be done to complete a task (or the component parts of a task), the next step is to create a plan for completing everything.</div> <div class="para" id="p-456">This may not be as easy or as simple as declaring that you will finish part one, then move on to part two, and so on. Each component may need different resources or skills to complete, and it is in your best interest to identify those ahead of time and include them as part of your plan.</div> <div class="para" id="p-457">A good analogy for this sort of planning is to think about it in much the same way you would preparing for a lengthy trip. With a long journey you probably would not walk out the front door and then decide how you were going to get where you were going. There are too many other decisions to be made and tasks to be completed around each choice. If you decided you were going by plane, you would need to purchase tickets, and you would have to schedule your trip around flight times. If you decided to go by car, you would need gas money and possibly a map or GPS device. What about clothes? The clothes you will need are dependent on how long you will be gone and what the climate will be like. If it is far enough away that you will need to speak another language, you may need to either acquire that skill or at least come with something or someone to help you translate.</div> <div class="para" id="p-458">What follows is a planning list that can help you think about and prepare for the tasks you are about to begin.</div> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-78"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">What Resources Will You Need?</span></h5> <div class="para" id="p-459">The first part of this list may appear to be so obvious that it should go without mention, but it is by far one of the most critical and one of the most overlooked. Have you ever planned a trip but forgotten your most comfortable pair of shoes or neglected to book a hotel room? If a missing resource is important, the entire project can come to a complete halt. Even if the missing resource is a minor component, it may still dramatically alter the end result.</div> <div class="para" id="p-460">Learning activities are much the same in this way, and it is also important to keep in mind that resources may not be limited to physical objects such as paper or ink. Information can be a critical resource as well. In fact, one of the most often overlooked aspects in planning by new college students is just how much research, reading, and information they will need to complete assignments.</div>       <div class="para" id="p-461">For example, if you had an assignment in which you were supposed to compare and contrast a novel with a film adapted from that novel, it would be important to have access to both the movie and the book as resources. Your plans for completing the work could quickly fall apart if you learned that on the evening you planned to watch the film, it was no longer available.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-79"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">What Skills Will You Need?</span></h5> <div class="para" id="p-462">Poor planning or a bad assumption in this area can be disastrous, especially if some part of the task has a steep learning curve. No matter how well you planned the other parts of the project, if there is some skill needed that you do not have and you have no idea how long it will take to learn, it can be a bad situation.</div> <div class="para" id="p-463">Imagine a scenario where one of your class projects is to create a poster. It is your intent to use some kind of imaging software to produce professional-looking graphics and charts for the poster, but you have never used the software in that way before. It seems easy enough, but once you begin, you find the charts keep printing out in the wrong resolution. You search online for a solution, but the only thing you can find requires you to recreate them all over again in a different setting. Unfortunately, that part of the project will now take twice as long.</div> <div class="para" id="p-464">It can be extremely difficult to recover from a situation like that, and it could have been prevented by taking the time to learn how to do it correctly before you began or by at least including in your schedule some time to learn and practice.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-80"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">What Deadlines Will You Create?</span></h5> <div class="para" id="p-465">Of course, the best way to approach time management is to set realistic deadlines that take into account which elements are dependent on which others and the order in which they should be completed. Giving yourself two days to write a 20- page work of fiction is not very realistic when even many professional authors average only 6 pages per day. Your intentions may be well founded, but your use of unrealistic deadlines will not be very successful.</div> <div class="para" id="p-466">Setting appropriate deadlines and sticking to them is very important—so much so that several sections in the rest of this chapter touch on effective deadline practices.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-81"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">How Will You Be Flexible?</span></h5> <div class="para" id="p-467">It is ironic that the item on this list that comes just after a strong encouragement to make deadlines and stick to them is the suggestion to be flexible. The reason that <em class="emphasis">being flexible</em> has made this list is because even the best-laid plans and most accurate time management efforts can take an unexpected turn. The idea behind being flexible is to readjust your plans and deadlines when something does happen to throw things off. The worst thing you could do in such a situation is panic or just stop working because the next step in your careful planning has suddenly become a roadblock. The moment when you see that something in your plan may become an issue is when to begin readjusting your plan.</div> <div class="para" id="p-468">Adjusting a plan along the way is incredibly common. In fact, many professional project managers have learned that it seems something <em class="emphasis">always</em> happens or there is always some delay, and they have developed an approach to deal with the inevitable need for some flexibility. In essence, you could say that they are even planning for problems, mistakes, or delays from the very beginning, and they will often add a little extra time for each task to help ensure an issue does not derail the entire project or that the completion of the project does not miss the final due date.</div> <div class="para" id="p-469"><em class="emphasis">“As you work through tasks, make certain you are always monitoring and adapting to ensure you complete them.”</em></div></section></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-82"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">The Importance of Where You Do Your Work.</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-470">Simple things, like where you are set up to do your work, can not only aid in your efficiency but also affect how well you can work or even if you can get the work completed at all. One example of this might be typing on a laptop. While it might seem more comfortable to lie back on a couch and type a long paper, sitting up at a desk or table actually increases your typing speed and reduces the number of mistakes. Even the kind of mouse you use can impact how you work, and using one you are comfortable with can make a big difference.</div> <div class="para" id="p-471">There are a host of other factors that can come into play as well. Do you have enough space? Is the space cluttered, or do you have the room to keep reference materials and other things you might need within arm’s reach? Are there other ways you could work that might be even more efficient? For example, buying an inexpensive second monitor—even secondhand—might be the key to decreasing the amount of time you spend when you can have more than one document displayed at a time.</div> <div class="para" id="p-472">The key is to find what works for you and to treat your work space as another important resource needed to get the task finished.</div> <div class="para" id="p-473">Few things are more frustrating than trying to do work while distractions are going on around you. If other people are continually interrupting you or there are things that keep pulling your attention from the task at hand, everything takes longer and you are more prone to mistakes.</div> <div class="para" id="p-474">If you find that your work is better without distractions, it is a good idea to create an environment that reduces interruptions. This may mean you have to go to a private room, use headphones, or go somewhere like a library to work. Regardless, the importance of a distraction-free environment cannot be emphasized enough.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-83"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">What Are the Best Times for You to Work?</span></h4> <div class="para" id="p-475">Most people are subject to their own rhythms, cycles, and preferences throughout their day. Some are alert and energetic in the mornings, while others are considered “night owls” and prefer to work after everyone else has gone to sleep. It can be important to be aware of your own cycles and to use them to your advantage. Rarely does anyone do their best work when they are exhausted, either physically or mentally. Just as it can be difficult to work when you are physically ill, it can also be a hindrance to try to learn or do mental work when you are tired or emotionally upset.</div> <div class="para" id="p-476">Your working environment definitely includes your own state of mind and physical well-being. Both have a significant influence on your learning and production ability. Because of this, it is not only important to be aware of your own condition and work preferences, but to actually try to create conditions that help you in these areas. One approach is to set aside a specific time to do certain kinds of work. You might find that you concentrate better after you have eaten a meal. If that is the case, make it a habit of doing homework every night after dinner. Or you might enjoy reading more after you are ready for bed, so you do your reading assignments just before you go to sleep at night. Some people find that they are more creative during a certain time of the day or that they are more comfortable writing with subtle lighting. It is worth taking the time to find the conditions that work best for you so that you can take advantage of them.</div></section></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-84"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Daily Top Three.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-477">The idea behind the <em class="emphasis">daily top three</em> approach is that you determine which three things are the most important to finish that day, and these become the tasks that you complete. It is a very simple technique that is effective because each day you are finishing tasks and removing them from your list. Even if you took one day off a week and completed no tasks on that particular day, a <em class="emphasis">daily top three</em> strategy would have you finishing 18 tasks in the course of a single week. That is a good amount of things crossed off your list.</div> </section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-85"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Pomodoro Technique.</span></h3>       <div class="para" id="p-478">The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo. The basic concept is to use a timer to set work intervals that are followed by a short break. The intervals are usually about 25 minutes long and are called <em class="emphasis">pomodoros</em>, which comes from the Italian word for tomato because Cirillo used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to keep track of the intervals.</div> <div class="para" id="p-479">In the original technique there are six steps:</div> <div class="para logical" id="p-480"><ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-114"><div class="para" id="p-481">Decide on the task to be done.</div></li>
<li id="li-115"><div class="para" id="p-482">Set the timer to the desired interval.</div></li>
<li id="li-116"><div class="para" id="p-483">Work on the task.</div></li>
<li id="li-117"><div class="para" id="p-484">When the timer goes off, put a check mark on a piece of paper.</div></li>
<li id="li-118"><div class="para" id="p-485">If you have fewer than four check marks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to Step 1 or 2 (whichever is appropriate).</div></li>
<li id="li-119"><div class="para" id="p-486">After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your check mark count to zero, and then go to Step 1 or 2.</div></li>
</ol></div>       <div class="para" id="p-487">There are several reasons this technique is deemed effective for many people. One is the benefit that is derived from quick cycles of work and short breaks. This helps reduce mental fatigue and the lack of productivity caused by it. Another is that it tends to encourage practitioners to break tasks down to things that can be completed in about 25 minutes, which is something that is usually manageable from the perspective of time available. It is much easier to squeeze in three 25-minute sessions of work time during the day than it is to set aside a 75- minute block of time.</div></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-86"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Eat the Frog.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-488">Of our three quick strategies, <em class="emphasis">eat the frog</em> probably has the strangest name and may not sound the most inviting. The name comes from a famous quote, attributed to Mark Twain: “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” <em class="emphasis">Eat the Frog</em> is also the title of a best- selling book by Brian Tracy that deals with time management and avoiding procrastination.</div> <div class="para" id="p-489">How this applies to time and task management is based on the concept that if a person takes care of the biggest or most unpleasant task first, everything else will be easier after that.</div> <div class="para" id="p-490">Although stated in a humorous way, there is a good deal of truth in this. First, we greatly underestimate how much worry can impact our performance. If you are continually distracted by anxiety over a task you are dreading, it can affect the task you are working on at the time. Second, not only will you have a sense of accomplishment and relief when the task you are concerned with is finished and out of the way, but other tasks will seem lighter and not as difficult.</div> </section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-87"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Breaking Down the Steps and Spreading Them Over Shorter Work Periods.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-491">Above, you read about several different tried-and-tested strategies for effective time management—approaches that have become staples in the professional world. In this section you will read about two more creative techniques that combine elements from these other methods to handle tasks when time is scarce and long periods of time are a luxury you just do not have.</div> <div class="para" id="p-492">The concept behind this strategy is to break tasks into smaller, more manageable units that do not require as much time to complete. As an illustration of how this might work, imagine that you are assigned a two-page paper that is to include references. You estimate that to complete the paper—start to finish—would take you between four and a half and five hours. You look at your calendar over the next week and see that there simply are no open five-hour blocks (unless you decided to only get three hours of sleep one night). Rightly so, you decide that going without sleep is not a good option. While looking at your calendar, you do see that you can squeeze in an hour or so every night. Instead of trying to write the entire paper in one sitting, you break it up into much smaller components and schedule them over the week</div></section></section></div>
