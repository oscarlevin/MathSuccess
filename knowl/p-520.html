<em class="emphasis">Increased risk of heart attack and stroke:</em> In his book <em class="emphasis">Why We Sleep</em>, Matthew Walker, PhD, shares Japanese research showing that male workers who average six hours of sleep or less are 400 to 500 percent more likely to suffer one or more cardiac arrests than those getting more than six hours of sleep each night. Another study of women between the ages of 20 and 79 found that those who had mild sleep disturbance such as taking longer to fall asleep or waking up one or more times during the night were significantly more likely to have high blood pressure than those who fell asleep quickly and slept soundly.Matthew Walker, PhD <em class="emphasis"><em class="emphasis">Why We Sleep</em></em>
