<div class="para">Sleep is the foundation of amazing health, yet almost 40 percent of adults struggle to get enough sleep.https://news.gallup.com/poll/166553/less-recommended-amount-sleep.aspx Lack of sleep affects mental and physical performance and can make you more irritable. The diminished energy that results from too little sleep often leads us to make poor decisions about most things, including food. Think about the last time you were really tired. Did you crave pizza, donuts, and friesâ€”or a healthy salad? Studies have shown that people who sleep less are more likely to eat fewer vegetables and eat more fats and refined carbohydrates, like donuts.Cleveland Clinic, https://health.clevelandclinic.org/lack-sleep-make-crave-junk-food/</div>
