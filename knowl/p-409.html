<div class="para">You may find that time management in college is very different from anything you have experienced previously. For high school students, almost all school time is managed by educators and parents. In many cases, even after-school time may be set by scheduled activities (such as athletics) and by nightly homework that is due the next day.In the workplace, the situation is not very different, with activities and time on task being monitored by the company and its management. See the table below for a comparison of high school students and college students with regard to time and task management.</div>
