<div class="para">Dan Harris, a news reporter at ABC, fell into drug use and suffered a major panic attack on national television. Following this embarrassing period in his life, he learned to meditate and found that it made him calmer and more resilient. He’s now on a mission to make meditation approachable to everyone. Dan used to be a skeptic about meditation but now says that if he learned to meditate, anyone can learn to meditate! Dan reminds us that we ARE going to get lost, and our mind IS going to stray, and that’s ok. Simply notice when you’re lost and start over. Every time your mind strays and your start over, it is like a bicep curl for your brain. Start with 3 minutes and slowly work your way up to 15 or 20. <a class="external" href="https://openstax.org/l/danharris" target="_blank">To hear more about Dan’s journey, watch this video</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-13-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a>, and for a simple meditation to get started, you can try one of the videos on the <a class="external" href="https://openstax.org/l/meditation" target="_blank">meditation Youtube channel</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-14-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a>.</div>
