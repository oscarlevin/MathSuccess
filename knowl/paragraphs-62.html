<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Loss of Self-Esteem.</span></h4> <div class="para">Often, when we procrastinate we become frustrated and disappointed in ourselves for not getting important tasks completed. If this continues to happen, we can begin to develop a low opinion of ourselves and our own abilities. We begin to suffer from low self-esteem and might even begin to feel like there is something wrong with us. This can lead to other increasingly negative mental factors such as anger and depression. As you can see, it is important for our own well-being to avoid this kind of procrastination effect.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-time-manage.html#paragraphs-62" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
