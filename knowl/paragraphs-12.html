<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Managing Note-Taking Systems.</span></h4> <div class="para">Whichever of the many note-taking systems you choose (and new ones seem to come out almost daily), the very best one is the one that you will use consistently. The skill and art of note-taking is not automatic for anyone; it takes a great deal of practice, patience, and continuous attention to detail. Add to that the fact that you may need to master multiple note-taking techniques for different classes, and you have some work to do. Unless you are specifically directed by your instructor, you are free to combine the best parts of different systems if you are most comfortable with that hybrid system.</div> <div class="para">Just to keep yourself organized, all your notes should start off with an identifier, including at the very least the date, the course name, the topic of the lecture/presentation, and any other information you think will help you when you return to use the notes for further study, test preparation, or assignment completion. Additional, optional information may be the number of note-taking sessions about this topic or reminders to cross-reference class handouts, textbook pages, or other course materials. Itâ€™s also always a good idea to leave some blank space in your notes so you can insert additions and questions you may have as you review the material later.</div> </section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-notetaking.html#paragraphs-12" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
