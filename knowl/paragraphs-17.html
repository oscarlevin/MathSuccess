<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Concept Mapping and Visual Note-Taking.</span></h4> <div class="para">One final note-taking method that appeals to learners who prefer a visual representation of notes is called <em class="emphasis">mapping</em> or sometimes <em class="emphasis">mind mapping</em> or <em class="emphasis">concept mapping,</em> although each of these names can have slightly different uses. Variations of this method abound, so you may want to look for more versions online, but the basic principles are that you are making connections between main ideas through a graphic depiction; some can get rather elaborate with colors and shapes, but a simple version may be more useful at least to begin. Main ideas can be circled or placed in a box with supporting concepts radiating off these ideas shown with a connecting line and possibly details of the support further radiating off the concepts. You can present your main ideas vertically or horizontally, but turning your paper long-ways, or in landscape mode, may prove helpful as you add more main ideas.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/../m00016/../../media/CS_Figure_03_04_012.jpg" class="contained" alt="A concept map shows a glob of student’s notes using connectors, bubbles, lists, symbols, and different colors."></div>

Sometimes when you can’t come up with the exact wording to explain something or you’re trying to add information for complex ideas in your notes, sketching a rough image of the idea can help you remember. According to educator Sherrill Knezel in an article entitled “The Power of Visual Note-taking,” this strategy is effective because “When students use images and text in note-taking, it gives them two different ways to pull up the information, doubling their chances of recall.” Don’t shy away from this creative approach to note-taking just because you believe you aren’t an artist; the images don’t need to be perfect.

You will become more efficient with the method the more you use it, and your note-taking, review, and test prep will become, if not easier, certainly more organized, which can decrease your anxiety.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-notetaking.html#paragraphs-17" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
