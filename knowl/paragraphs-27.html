<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Benefits of Working in Groups.</span></h3> <div class="para">When a professor assigns group work, most students initially cringe because they have had poor experiences collaborating on a project. Many of them have tales of group members who didn’t contribute equally or who disappeared altogether. It is no wonder that a popular meme includes a photo of a casket being lowered into the ground with the words “When I die, I want my group members to lower me into my grave so they can let me down one last time.” We can laugh at this extreme reaction, but there is some truth in feeling apprehension about being disappointed by others. This section makes the case that if you know more about how group dynamics can and should work and how to communicate effectively during the process of completing a group project, you are more likely to have a positive – or successful – experience.</div>  <div class="para">Why do professors assign group projects if they are often fraught with challenges? Perhaps it is because group projects are probably the most “real world” experience you will do in college. Very rarely will you be asked to create a report, present to a client, develop a new product or treatment, or fix a problem without working with others and depending on them to do their parts in a timely and professional manner. The more practice you have developing your own skills as a group member and troubleshooting when things don’t go smoothly, the more nimble you will be when you have to collaborate in your job.</div> <div class="para">If you approach working in groups by anticipating the challenges and developing strategies to minimize their negative impact, you will be able to weather the stresses more successfully. The table below provides some common challenges that you may experience working in a group and reviews the strategies you can use to minimize or eliminate the challenges.</div> <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">2.4.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">
