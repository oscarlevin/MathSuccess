The term <em class="emphasis">hidden curriculum</em>, which was coined by sociologists,P.P. Bilbao, P. I. Lucido, T. C. Iringan and R. B. Javier. (2008). <em class="emphasis">Curriculum Development</em>. describes unspoken, unwritten, or unacknowledged (hence, <em class="emphasis">hidden</em>) rules that students are expected to follow that can affect their learning.</div> <div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Situation:</em> According to your syllabus, your history professor is lecturing on the chapter that covers the stock market crash of 1929 on Tuesday of next week.</div> <div class="para">Sounds pretty straightforward. Your professor lectures on a topic and you will be there to hear it. However, there are some unwritten rules, or <dfn class="terminology">hidden curriculum</dfn>, that are not likely to be communicated. Can you guess what they may be?</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">

</table></div></figure> <div class="para">The expectations before, during, and after class, as well as what you should do if you miss class, are often unspoken because many professors assume you already know and do these things or because they feel you should figure them out on your own. Nonetheless, some students struggle at first because they don’t know about these habits, behaviors, and strategies. But once they learn them, they are able to meet them with ease.</div> </section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-hidden-curriculum.html#paragraphs-2" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
