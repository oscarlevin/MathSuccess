<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Strategies for Psyching Ourselves Out and Managing Procrastination.</span></h3> <div class="para">Now that you understand a few of the major problems procrastination can produce, let’s look at methods to manage procrastination and get you on to completing the tasks, no matter how unpleasant you think they might be.</div> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Get Organized.</span></h4> <div class="para">Much of this chapter is dedicated to defining and explaining the nature of time management. The most effective way to combat procrastination is to use time and project management strategies such as schedules, goal setting, and other techniques to get tasks accomplished in a timely manner.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Put Aside Distractions.</span></h4> <div class="para">Several of the methods discussed in this chapter deal specifically with distractions. Distractions are time-killers and are the primary way people procrastinate. It is too easy to just play a video game a little while longer, check out social media, or finish watching a movie when we are avoiding a task. Putting aside distractions is one of the primary functions of setting priorities.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Reward Yourself.</span></h4> <div class="para">Rewarding yourself for the completion of tasks or meeting goals is a good way to avoid procrastination. An example of this would be rewarding yourself with the time to watch a movie you would enjoy a<em class="emphasis">fter</em> you have finished the things you need to do, rather than using the movie to keep yourself from getting things done.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Be Accountable.</span></h4> <div class="para">A strong motivational tool is to hold ourselves accountable by telling someone else we are going to do something and when we are going to do it. This may not seem like it would be very effective, but on a psychological level we feel more compelled to do something if we tell someone else. It may be related to our need for approval from others, or it might just serve to set a level of commitment. Either way, it can help us stay on task and avoid procrastination—especially if we take our accountability to another person seriously enough to warrant contacting that person and apologizing for not doing what we said we were going to do.</div></section></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-time-manage.html#paragraphs-64" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
