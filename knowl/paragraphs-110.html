<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Academic Advisors.</span></h3> <div class="para">All colleges and universities provide resources such as a curriculum map to assist you with your academic planning. <dfn class="terminology">Academic advisors</dfn> may also be called success coaches, mentors, preceptors, or counselors. They may be staff members, or faculty may provide advisement as an additional role to their teaching responsibilities. Regardless of what your college calls this role, academic advisors are individuals who are able to assist you in navigating the puzzle of your academic plan and piecing your courses and requirements together with your other life obligations to help you meet your goals.</div> <div class="para">An advisor is an expert on college and major requirements and policies, while you are the expert on your life circumstances and your ability to manage your study time and workload. It is also an advisorâ€™s responsibility to understand the details of your degree requirements. This person can teach you how to best utilize college resources to make decisions about your academic and career path. An advisor can help you connect with other college staff and faculty who might be integral to supporting your success. Together with your advisor, you can create a semester-by-semester plan for the courses you will take and the special requirements you will meet. Refer to the end of this section for a detailed planning template that you could use in this process. Even if your college does not require advising, it is wise to meet with your advisor every semester to both check your progress and learn about new opportunities that might lend you competitive advantage in entering your career.</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Common Functions of Academic Advisors</em></div> <div class="para">Academic advisors can help you:</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">
