<div class="para">Create a sleeping environment that is comfortable and conducive to sleep. If you can control the temperature in your room, keep it cool in the evening. Scientists believe a cool bedroom (around 65 degrees) may be best for sleep, since it mimics our body’s natural temperature drop. Exposure to bright light suppresses our body’s ability to make melatonin, so keep the room as dark as possible. A 2010 study in <em class="emphasis">The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism</em>found that individuals exposed to room light “during the usual hours of sleep suppressed melatonin by greater than 50%.”JCEM, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047226/ Even the tiniest bit of light in the room (like from a clock radio LCD screen) can disrupt your internal clock and your production of melatonin, which will interfere with your sleep. A sleep mask may help eliminate light, and earplugs can help reduce noise.</div>
