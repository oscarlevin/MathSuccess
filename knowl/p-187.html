<div class="para">The research-based model of these two mindsets and their influence on learning was presented in 1988 by Carol Dweck. In Dweck’s work, she determined that a student’s perception about their own learning accompanied by a broader goal of learning had a significant influence on their ability to overcome challenges and grow in knowledge and ability. This has become known as the Fixed vs. Growth Mindset model. In this model, the <em class="emphasis">performance</em>-goal-oriented student is represented by the <em class="emphasis">fixed</em> mindset, while the <em class="emphasis">learning</em>-goal- oriented student is represented by the <em class="emphasis">growth</em> mindset.</div>
