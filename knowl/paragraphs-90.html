<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Tips to Improve the Quality of Your Sleep.</span></h3> <div class="para">Now that you are more aware of the ways insufficient sleep harms your body, let’s review some of the things you can do to enhance your sleep.</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Make sleep a priority.</em></div> <div class="para">It can be challenging in college, but try to get on a schedule where you sleep and wake at the same time every day to get your body accustomed to a routine. This will help your body get into a sleep rhythm and make it easier to fall asleep and get up in the morning.</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Sleep in a cool, quiet, dark room.</em></div> <div class="para">Create a sleeping environment that is comfortable and conducive to sleep. If you can control the temperature in your room, keep it cool in the evening. Scientists believe a cool bedroom (around 65 degrees) may be best for sleep, since it mimics our body’s natural temperature drop. Exposure to bright light suppresses our body’s ability to make melatonin, so keep the room as dark as possible. A 2010 study in <em class="emphasis">The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism</em>found that individuals exposed to room light “during the usual hours of sleep suppressed melatonin by greater than 50%.”JCEM, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047226/ Even the tiniest bit of light in the room (like from a clock radio LCD screen) can disrupt your internal clock and your production of melatonin, which will interfere with your sleep. A sleep mask may help eliminate light, and earplugs can help reduce noise.</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Avoid eating late or drinking alcohol or caffeine close to bedtime.</em></div> <div class="para">It is best to finish eating at least two hours before bedtime and avoid caffeine after lunch. While not everyone is affected in the same way, caffeine hangs around a long time in most bodies. Although alcohol will make you drowsy, the effect is short-lived and you will often wake up several hours later, unable to fall back to sleep. Alcohol can also keep you from entering the deeper stages of sleep, where your body does most of the repair and healing. A 2013 <em class="emphasis">Scientific Research</em> study concluded that “energy drinks, other caffeinated beverages and alcoholic beverages are risk factors of poor sleep quality.” It’s important to finish eating hours before bedtime so your body is able to heal and detoxify and it is not spending the first few hours of sleep digesting a heavy meal.</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Start to wind down an hour before bed.</em></div> <div class="para">There are great apps to help with relaxation, stress release, and falling asleep. Or you can simply practice 4-7-8 breathing to calm your nervous system—breathe in to the count of 4, hold your breath for a count of 7, and release your breath slowly to the count of 8.</div> <div class="para">Consider the <a class="external" href="http://insighttimer.com" target="_blank">Insight Timer</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-8-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> app, or any of the <a class="external" href="https://openstax.org/l/sleepapps" target="_blank">free apps</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-9-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> listed by the American Sleep Association.</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Exercise for 30 minutes a day.</em></div> <div class="para">One of the biggest benefits of exercise is its effect on sleep. A study from Stanford University found that 16 weeks in a moderate-intensity exercise program allowed people to fall asleep about 15 minutes faster and sleep about 45 minutes longer. Walking, yoga, swimming, strength training, jumping rope—whatever it is, find an exercise you like and make sure to move your body every day.</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Improve your diet.</em></div> <div class="para">Low fiber and high saturated fat and sugar intake is associated with lighter, less restorative sleep with more wake time during the night. Processed food full of chemicals will make your body work extra hard during the night to remove the toxins and leave less time for healing and repair.</div> <div class="para">Sleep affects how we look, feel, and function on a daily basis and is vital to our health and quality of life. When you get the sleep your body needs, you look more vibrant, you feel more vibrant, and you have the energy to live your best life.</div> <div class="para">Now, with a better understanding of the benefits of getting the recommended hours of nightly sleep and the health risks of not getting enough sleep, what changes can you make to improve the quality and quantity of your sleep?</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-gen-health.html#paragraphs-90" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
