<em class="emphasis">Read the entire question carefully even if you think you know what the stem (the introduction of the choices) says, and read all the choices.</em> Skip really difficult questions or ones where your brain goes blank. Then you can go back and concentrate on those skipped ones later after you have answered the majority of the questions confidently. Sometimes a later question will trigger an idea in your mind that will help you answer the skipped questions.</div>
