<div class="para">And, in a similar fashion to spending a few minutes right at the beginning of the test time to read the directions carefully and identify the test elements, <em class="emphasis">allow yourself a few minutes at the end of the exam session to review your answers.</em> Depending on what sort of exam it is, you can use this time to check your math computations, review an essay for grammatical and content errors, or answer the difficult multiple-choice questions you skipped earlier. Finally, <em class="emphasis">make sure you have completed the entire test:</em> check the backs of pages, and verify that you have a corresponding answer section for every question section on the exam. It can be easy to skip a section with the idea you will come back to it but then forget to return there, which can have a significant impact on your test results.</div>
