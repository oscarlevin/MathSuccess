<dfn class="terminology">Major courses</dfn> are courses in your field of interest and provide you with the foundational knowledge required for further study in that field or with the skills necessary to enter your career. Some schools may refer to these as <em class="emphasis">career studies</em> courses. Major courses often have a series of <em class="emphasis">prerequisites</em>, or courses that must be taken in sequence prior to other courses, starting with an introductory course and progressing into more depth. Major courses usually make up about a fourth or more of a bachelor’s degree (30 credits, or approximately 10 courses). A BS or BFA degree may require more major courses than a BA degree. Colleges and universities usually require students to select a major by the time they’ve completed 30 total credits.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-degree-planning.html#paragraphs-99" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
