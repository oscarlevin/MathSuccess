<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Test Day.</span></h3> <div class="para">Once you get to the exam session, try your best to focus on nothing but the exam. This can be very difficult with all the distractions in our lives. But if you have done all the groundwork to attend the classes, completed the assignments, and scheduled your exam prep time, you are ready to focus intently for the comparatively short time most exams last.</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Arriving to class:</em></div> <div class="para">Don’t let yourself be sidetracked right at the end. Beyond the preparation we’ve discussed, give yourself some more advantages on the actual test day:</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Get to the testing location a few minutes early so you can settle into your place and take a few relaxing breaths.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Don’t let other classmates interrupt your calmness at this point.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Just get to your designated place, take out whatever supplies and materials you are allowed to have, and calm your mind.</div></li>
</ul></div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Taking the test:</em></div> <div class="para">Once the instructor begins the test:</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Listen carefully for any last-minute oral directions that may have changed some detail on the exam, such as the timing or the content of the questions.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">As soon as you receive the exam sheet or packet, make a quick scan over the entire test.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Don’t spend a lot of time on this initial glance, but make sure you are familiar with the layout and what you need to do.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Using this first review, decide how you will allocate your available time for each section.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You can even jot down how many minutes you can allow for the different sections or questions.</div></li>
</ul></div> <div class="para">Then for each section, if the exam is divided this way, be sure you <em class="emphasis">read the section directions</em> very carefully so you don’t miss an important detail. For example, instructors often offer options—so you may have four short-answer questions from which to choose, but you only need to answer two of them. If you had not read the directions for that section, you may have thought you needed to provide answers to all four prompts. Working on extra questions for which you likely will receive no credit would be a waste of your limited exam time. The extra time you spend at the beginning is like an investment in your overall results.</div> <div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Answer every required question on the exam.</em> Even if you don’t complete each one, you may receive some credit for partial answers. Whether or not you can receive partial credit would be an excellent question to ask before the exam during the preparation time. If you are taking an exam that contains multiple-choice questions, go through and answer the questions about which you are the most confident first.</div> <div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Read the entire question carefully even if you think you know what the stem (the introduction of the choices) says, and read all the choices.</em> Skip really difficult questions or ones where your brain goes blank. Then you can go back and concentrate on those skipped ones later after you have answered the majority of the questions confidently. Sometimes a later question will trigger an idea in your mind that will help you answer the skipped questions.</div> <div class="para">And, in a similar fashion to spending a few minutes right at the beginning of the test time to read the directions carefully and identify the test elements, <em class="emphasis">allow yourself a few minutes at the end of the exam session to review your answers.</em> Depending on what sort of exam it is, you can use this time to check your math computations, review an essay for grammatical and content errors, or answer the difficult multiple-choice questions you skipped earlier. Finally, <em class="emphasis">make sure you have completed the entire test:</em> check the backs of pages, and verify that you have a corresponding answer section for every question section on the exam. It can be easy to skip a section with the idea you will come back to it but then forget to return there, which can have a significant impact on your test results.</div> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">After the Test.</span></h4> <div class="para">As you leave the exam room, the last thing you may want to think about is that particular test. You probably have numerous other assignments, projects, and life obligations to attend to, especially if you pushed some of those off to study for this completed exam. Give yourself some space from this exam, but only for the duration of the time when your instructor is grading your exam. Once you have your results, study them—whether you did really well (Go, you!) or not as well as you had hoped (Keep your spirits up!). Both scenarios hold valuable information if you will use it.</div> <div class="para">Thandie had a habit of going all-out for exams before she took them, and she did pretty well usually, but once the instructor passed back the graded tests, she would look at the letter grade, glance half-heartedly at the instructor’s comments, and toss the exam away, ready to move on to the next chapter, section, or concept. A better plan would be to learn from her exam results and analyze both what she did well and where she struggled. After a particularly unimpressive exam outing in her statistics class, Thandie took her crumpled-up exam to the campus tutoring center, where the tutor reviewed the test with her section by section. Together they discovered that Thandie did particularly well on the computational sections, which she admitted were her favorites, and not well at all on the short-answer essay questions that she did not expect to find in a stats class, which in her experience had been more geared toward the mathematical side of solving statistical problems.</div> <div class="para">Going forward in this class, Thandie should practice writing out her explanations of how to compute the problems and talk to her instructor about ways to hone this skill. This tutoring session also proved to Thandie the benefit of holding on to important class papers—either electronically or in hard copy, depending on the class setup—for future reference. For some classes, you probably don’t need to keep every scrap of paper (or file) associated with your notes, exams, assignments, and projects, but for others, especially for those in your major, those early class materials may come in very handy in your more difficult later undergraduate courses or even in grad school when you need a quick refresher on the basic concepts.</div></section></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-test-take.html#paragraphs-46" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
