<div class="para">“Syllabus” is another word that you may not have encountered, but it is one you will soon know very well. A syllabus is often called the “contract of the course” because it contains information about what to expect—from the professor and the student. It is meant to be a roadmap for succeeding in the class. Understanding that student/office hours are for you to ask your professor questions and the syllabus is the guide for what you will be doing in the class can make a big difference in your transition to college. The table on Common <dfn class="terminology">College Terms</dfn>, below, has a brief list of other words that you will want to know when you hear them on campus (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/m00004-ch01tab07.html" title="Table 1.1.1: Common College Terms, What They Mean, and Why You Need to Know">Table 1.1.1</a>).</div>
