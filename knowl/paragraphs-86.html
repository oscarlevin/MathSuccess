<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Eat the Frog.</span></h3> <div class="para">Of our three quick strategies, <em class="emphasis">eat the frog</em> probably has the strangest name and may not sound the most inviting. The name comes from a famous quote, attributed to Mark Twain: “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” <em class="emphasis">Eat the Frog</em> is also the title of a best- selling book by Brian Tracy that deals with time management and avoiding procrastination.</div> <div class="para">How this applies to time and task management is based on the concept that if a person takes care of the biggest or most unpleasant task first, everything else will be easier after that.</div> <div class="para">Although stated in a humorous way, there is a good deal of truth in this. First, we greatly underestimate how much worry can impact our performance. If you are continually distracted by anxiety over a task you are dreading, it can affect the task you are working on at the time. Second, not only will you have a sense of accomplishment and relief when the task you are concerned with is finished and out of the way, but other tasks will seem lighter and not as difficult.</div> </section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-time-manage.html#paragraphs-86" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
