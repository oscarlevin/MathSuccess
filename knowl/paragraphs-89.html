Studies have linked poor sleep to a variety of health problems. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have identified sleep deprivation as a public health epidemic.</div> <div class="para">A lack of sleep can change the way your genes express themselves. One notable study involved a group of healthy adults limited to six hours of sleep for one week. Researchers then measured the change in gene activity compared to the prior week when these same people were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night. The lack of sleep caused the activity of 711 genes to become distorted. About half of the genes were switched off by a lack of sleep, and these genes were associated with the immune system. The other half of the genes experienced increased activity from a lack of sleep, and these were genes associated with the promotion of tumors, genes associated with long-term chronic inflammation, and stress genes.Archer, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23440187</div>  <div class="para">Some of the health risks of insufficient sleep include the following:</div> <div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Increased risk of heart attack and stroke:</em> In his book <em class="emphasis">Why We Sleep</em>, Matthew Walker, PhD, shares Japanese research showing that male workers who average six hours of sleep or less are 400 to 500 percent more likely to suffer one or more cardiac arrests than those getting more than six hours of sleep each night. Another study of women between the ages of 20 and 79 found that those who had mild sleep disturbance such as taking longer to fall asleep or waking up one or more times during the night were significantly more likely to have high blood pressure than those who fell asleep quickly and slept soundly.Matthew Walker, PhD <em class="emphasis"><em class="emphasis">Why We Sleep</em></em>

<em class="emphasis">Impaired cognitive function:</em> Even one night of sleeping less than six hours can impact your ability to think clearly the next day.</div> <div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Increased risk of accidents:</em> Sleep deprivation slows your reaction time, which increases your risk of accidents. You are three times more likely to be in a car crash if you are tired. According to the American Sleep Foundation, 40 percent of people admitted to falling asleep behind the wheel at least once. A Governor’s Highway Safety Association report estimates there are 6,400 fatal drowsy driving crashes each year. Fifty percent of these crashes involve drivers under the age of 25.Governors Highway Safety Association</div>  <div class="para">Driving after 20 hours without sleep is the equivalent of driving with a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent—the U.S. legal limit for drunk driving.</div> <div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Weight gain/increased risk for obesity:</em> Sleep helps balance your appetite by regulating hormones that play a role in helping you feel full after a meal. Also, cortisol is released during times of anxiety, and exhaustion causes your body to produce more cortisol. This can stimulate your appetite.</div> <div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Increased risk of cancer:</em> Tumors grow up to three times faster in laboratory animals with severe sleep dysfunctions. Researchers believe this is because of disrupted melatonin production, as melatonin has both antioxidant and anticancer activity.</div> <div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Increased emotional intensity:</em> The part of the brain responsible for emotional reactions, your amygdala, can be 60 percent more reactive when you’ve slept poorly, resulting in increased emotional intensity.</div> <div class="para">For more information on the advantages and health risks of sleep watch this <a class="external" href="https://openstax.org/l/sleepsuperpower" target="_blank">TED Talk</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-7-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> by Matt Walker, PhD, Director of the Sleep Center at U California Berkeley.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-gen-health.html#paragraphs-89" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
