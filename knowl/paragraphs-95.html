<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Mindfulness.</span></h4> <div class="para">Mindfulness means being present with your thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment. Mindfulness is also without judgement—meaning there is no right or wrong way to think or feel in a given moment. When we practice mindfulness, our thoughts tune into what we’re sensing in the present moment rather than rehashing the past or imagining the future.Moran, Joan; University of California at Los Angeles, http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/gratitude-249167</div> <div class="para">Anything that keeps you present in the moment and gives your prefrontal cortex (the reasoning and thinking part of your brain) a break is practicing mindfulness. Mindfulness can be a slow walk; looking intently at the grass, trees, flowers, or buildings; and being aware of what you are sensing and feeling. Mindfulness can be sitting quietly—even sitting still in a quiet place for as little as a few minutes can reduce heart rate and blood pressure.The Greater Good Science Center, UC Berkeley https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/</div> <div class="para">Developing a practice of mindfulness is easier than you may think:</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">

<em class="emphasis">Slow down.</em> From brushing your teeth, to washing your face, to shampooing your hair—can you take the speed out of getting ready in the morning? Focus on the activity, pay attention to what you are doing, stay present (this means don’t think about what happened last night or what’s in store for the day, just stay focused on the activity), and take your time.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Focus on your breath.</em> How fast are you breathing? Is your breath coming from your chest or your belly? Can you feel the air come through your nose on the inhale? Can you slow down the exhale? Can you feel your body relax when you slow the exhale?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Connect to your environment.</em> Walk for a few minutes, focused on the world around you—look at the leaves on the trees or the light at the corner, listen to the sounds around you, stay with your surroundings, and observe what you see and hear around you.</div></li>

By practicing mindfulness all of us have the capacity to develop a deeper sense of calm.”</em></div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">— Rick Hanson, author, Resilient</em></div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-gen-health.html#paragraphs-95" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
