<em class="emphasis">Feel like an imposter.</em> There is actually a name for this condition: <dfn class="terminology">imposter syndrome</dfn>. Students who feel like an imposter are worried that they don’t belong, that someone will “expose them for being a fake.” This feeling is pretty common for anyone who finds themselves in a new environment and is not sure if they have what it takes to succeed. Trust the professionals who work with first-year college students: you <span class="process-math">\(do\)</span> have what it takes, and you <em class="emphasis">will</em> succeed. Just give yourself time to get adjusted to everything.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Worry about making a mistake.</em> This concern often goes with imposter syndrome. Students who worry about making a mistake don’t like to answer questions in class, volunteer for a challenging assignment, and even ask for help from others. Instead of avoiding situations where you may fail, embrace the process of learning, which includes—is even dependent on—making mistakes. The more you practice courage in these situations and focus on what you are going to learn from failing, the more confident you become about your abilities.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Try to manage everything yourself.</em> Even superheroes need help from sidekicks and mere mortals. Trying to handle everything on your own every time an issue arises is a recipe for getting stressed out. There will be times when you are overwhelmed by all you have to do. This is when you will need to ask for and allow others to help you.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Ignore your mental and physical health needs.</em> If you feel you are on an emotional rollercoaster and you cannot find time to take care of yourself, then you have most likely ignored some part of your mental and physical well-being. What you need to do to stay healthy should be non-negotiable. In other words, your sleep, eating habits, exercise, and stress-reducing activities should be your highest priorities.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Forget to enjoy the experience.</em> Whether you are 18 years old and living on campus or 48 years old starting back to college after taking a break to work and raise a family, be sure to take the time to remind yourself of the joy that learning can bring.</div></li>
