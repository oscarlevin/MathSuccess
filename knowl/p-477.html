<div class="para">The idea behind the <em class="emphasis">daily top three</em> approach is that you determine which three things are the most important to finish that day, and these become the tasks that you complete. It is a very simple technique that is effective because each day you are finishing tasks and removing them from your list. Even if you took one day off a week and completed no tasks on that particular day, a <em class="emphasis">daily top three</em> strategy would have you finishing 18 tasks in the course of a single week. That is a good amount of things crossed off your list.</div>
