<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">What Deadlines Will You Create?</span></h5> <div class="para">Of course, the best way to approach time management is to set realistic deadlines that take into account which elements are dependent on which others and the order in which they should be completed. Giving yourself two days to write a 20- page work of fiction is not very realistic when even many professional authors average only 6 pages per day. Your intentions may be well founded, but your use of unrealistic deadlines will not be very successful.</div> <div class="para">Setting appropriate deadlines and sticking to them is very importantâ€”so much so that several sections in the rest of this chapter touch on effective deadline practices.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-time-manage.html#paragraphs-80" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
