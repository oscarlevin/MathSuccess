<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">The Effects of Procrastination.</span></h3> <div class="para">In addition to the causes of procrastination, you must also consider what effects it can have. Again, many of these effects are obvious and commonly understood, but some may not be so obvious and may cause other issues.</div> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Loss of Time.</span></h4> <div class="para">The loss of time as an effect of procrastination is the easiest to identify since the act of avoiding a task comes down to not using time wisely. Procrastination can be thought of as using the time you have to complete a task in ways that do not accomplish what needs to be done.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Loss of Goals.</span></h4> <div class="para">Another of the more obvious potentially adverse effects of procrastination is the loss of goals. Completing a task leads to achieving a goal. These can be large or small (e.g., from doing well on an assignment to being hired for a good job). Without goals you might do more than delay work on a task—you may not complete it at all. The risk for the loss of goals is something that is very impactful.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Loss of Self-Esteem.</span></h4> <div class="para">Often, when we procrastinate we become frustrated and disappointed in ourselves for not getting important tasks completed. If this continues to happen, we can begin to develop a low opinion of ourselves and our own abilities. We begin to suffer from low self-esteem and might even begin to feel like there is something wrong with us. This can lead to other increasingly negative mental factors such as anger and depression. As you can see, it is important for our own well-being to avoid this kind of procrastination effect.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Stress.</span></h4> <div class="para">Procrastination causes stress and anxiety, which may seem odd since the act of procrastination is often about avoiding a task we think will be stressful in itself! Anyone who has noticed that nagging feeling when they know there is something else they should be doing is familiar with this.</div> <div class="para">On the other hand, some students see that kind of stress as a boost of mental urgency. They put off a task until they feel that surge of motivation. While this may have worked in the past, they quickly learn that procrastinating when it comes to college work almost always includes an underestimation of the tasks to be completed— sometimes with disastrous results.</div></section></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-time-manage.html#paragraphs-59" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
