<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Establishing Realistic Expectations for Test Situations.</span></h4> <div class="para">Would you expect to make a perfect pastry if you’ve never learned how to bake? Or paint a masterpiece if you’ve never tried to work with paints and brushes? Probably not. But often we expect ourselves to perform at much higher levels of achievement than that for which we’ve actually prepared. If you become very upset and stressed if you make any score lower than the highest, you probably need to reevaluate your own expectations for test situations. Striving to always do your best is an admirable goal. Realistically knowing that your current <em class="emphasis">best</em> may not achieve the highest academic ratings can help you plot your progress.</div> <div class="para">Realistic continuous improvement is a better plan, because people who repeatedly attempt challenges for which they have not adequately prepared and understandably fail (or at least do not achieve the desired highest ranking) often start moving toward the goal in frustration. They simply quit. This doesn’t mean you settle for mediocre grades or refrain from your challenges. It means you become increasingly aware of yourself and your current state and potential future. Know yourself, know your strengths and weaknesses, and be honest with yourself about your expectations.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-test-take.html#paragraphs-43" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
