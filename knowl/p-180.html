<div class="para">Much of our ability to learn is governed by our motivations and goals. Sometimes hidden goals or mindsets can impact the learning process. In truth, we all have goals that we might not be fully aware of, or if we are aware of them, we might not understand how they help or restrict our ability to learn. An illustration of this can be seen in a comparison of a student that has <em class="emphasis">performance</em>-based goals with a student that has <em class="emphasis">learning</em>-based goals.</div>
