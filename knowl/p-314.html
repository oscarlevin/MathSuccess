<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">No leader.</em> When no leader emerges, it may be difficult to move forward. If this happens, each member may need to take a specific task and assume responsibility for that task. Group members who are not comfortable being the leader may also feel more comfortable with co-leaders.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Too many leaders.</em> Many people with good ideas can derail a group project. If there are too many people vying to influence the groupâ€™s direction, ask all group members to speak openly about the conflict. The group may want to vote on who should assume the leadership positions or what direction the group should take if there are more than one good option.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Aggressiveness or hostility.</em> A group member who tries to take over the project or is openly hostile during the process can make the experience miserable for everyone involved. The leader should take action immediately when the issue arises by clearly naming the behavior, avoiding emotional language, asking the reasons behind the anger, and communicating a plan to move forward with the project. This may mean assigning the member to a specific and limited role, or, in extreme situations, removing (or asking to remove) the member from the group.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Lack of communication.</em> A group member who never responds to messages or who communicates inconsistently can make completing a group project very difficult. The leader should go back to the group contract and reach out to the member, preferably in writing, and describe the missing communication, the tasks that have not been completed, and what the group will be doing to move forward without the group member. Even if the group member never reads or responds to the message, the group will have evidence that they attempted to reach out.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Overpromising and underperforming.</em> A group member that takes on tasks, promises to do them well and on time, and consistently misses the mark should be talked with about the lack of work. A group member may need to take on their responsibilities to meet the deadline.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Low work quality.</em> If a member is not completing quality work, the group leader should step in to work with the other members to revise or edit the work, but the group should communicate with the member as to what has changed and why.</div></li>
