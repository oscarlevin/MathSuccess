<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">How Will You Be Flexible?</span></h5> <div class="para">It is ironic that the item on this list that comes just after a strong encouragement to make deadlines and stick to them is the suggestion to be flexible. The reason that <em class="emphasis">being flexible</em> has made this list is because even the best-laid plans and most accurate time management efforts can take an unexpected turn. The idea behind being flexible is to readjust your plans and deadlines when something does happen to throw things off. The worst thing you could do in such a situation is panic or just stop working because the next step in your careful planning has suddenly become a roadblock. The moment when you see that something in your plan may become an issue is when to begin readjusting your plan.</div> <div class="para">Adjusting a plan along the way is incredibly common. In fact, many professional project managers have learned that it seems something <em class="emphasis">always</em> happens or there is always some delay, and they have developed an approach to deal with the inevitable need for some flexibility. In essence, you could say that they are even planning for problems, mistakes, or delays from the very beginning, and they will often add a little extra time for each task to help ensure an issue does not derail the entire project or that the completion of the project does not miss the final due date.</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">“As you work through tasks, make certain you are always monitoring and adapting to ensure you complete them.”</em></div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-time-manage.html#paragraphs-81" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
