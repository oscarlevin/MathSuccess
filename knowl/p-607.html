<div class="para">All colleges and universities provide resources such as a curriculum map to assist you with your academic planning. <dfn class="terminology">Academic advisors</dfn> may also be called success coaches, mentors, preceptors, or counselors. They may be staff members, or faculty may provide advisement as an additional role to their teaching responsibilities. Regardless of what your college calls this role, academic advisors are individuals who are able to assist you in navigating the puzzle of your academic plan and piecing your courses and requirements together with your other life obligations to help you meet your goals.</div>
