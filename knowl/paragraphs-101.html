<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Graduate Degrees.</span></h3> <div class="para">According to United States Census data published in 2018, 13.1 percent of the U.S. adult population have completed advanced degrees.United States Census Bureau. (2019, February 21). Number of People with Master’s and Doctoral Degrees Doubles Since 2000. Retrieved from: https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/02/number-of-people-with-masters-and-phd-degrees-double-since-2000.html Whereas associate and bachelor’s degrees are considered undergraduate degrees and require high school graduation for entry, advanced degrees called <dfn class="terminology">graduate degrees</dfn> require prior completion of a bachelor’s degree. Some professions require graduate degrees as a minimum job qualification, such as pharmacists, lawyers, physical therapists, psychologists, and college professors. In other cases, students may be motivated to pursue a graduate degree to obtain a higher-level job or higher salary, or to be more competitive in their field. Some students are also interested in learning about some subject in greater depth than they did at the undergraduate level. Because graduate degrees do not include general education or free elective courses, they are very focused on career-specific knowledge and skills. Graduate degrees include master’s, doctoral, and professional degrees. <em class="emphasis">Master’s degrees</em> often require 30–60 credits and take one to two years of full-time attendance to complete. Some <dfn class="terminology">master’s degrees</dfn>, like those for counselors, require supervised job experience as a component of the degree and therefore require more credits.</div>       <div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Doctorate and professional degrees</em> are the highest level of advanced degrees. Approximately 3.5% of the U.S. adult population has completed a doctorate or professional degree. Very few careers require this level of education for entry, so fewer individuals pursue these degrees. Doctorates are offered in many subjects and primarily prepare students to become researchers in their field of study. This in-depth level of education often requires an additional 90–120 credits beyond the bachelor’s degree, and may or may not require a master’s degree prior to entry. (A master’s degree as an entry requirement may reduce the number of credits required to complete the doctoral degree.)</div> <div class="para">Professional degrees are a specific type of doctorate-level degree that focus on skills to be applied in a <em class="emphasis">practical</em>, or hands-on, career rather than as a researcher. The most common professional degrees are Doctor of Medicine (MD) for aspiring medical doctors, Juris Doctor (JD) for aspiring lawyers, Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) for aspiring pharmacists, and Doctor of Education (EdD) for aspiring school and college or university administrators. If the career you are pursuing requires a graduate degree, you should keep this end goal in mind as you plan for the timeline and finances required to meet your goals. You may also want to inquire about special agreements that your college or university may have to expedite admission into or completion of graduate degrees. For example, some universities offer <em class="emphasis">4+1 master’s programs</em>, wherein students take both bachelor’s and master’s level courses during their last year as an undergraduate to accelerate the completion of both degrees.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-degree-planning.html#paragraphs-101" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
