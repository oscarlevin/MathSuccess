<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Mindfulness and Gratitude.</span></h3> <div class="para">Deep breathing, mindfulness, and a practice of gratitude are some of the most effective ways to manage stress and take care of your emotional health.</div> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Mindfulness.</span></h4> <div class="para">Mindfulness means being present with your thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment. Mindfulness is also without judgement—meaning there is no right or wrong way to think or feel in a given moment. When we practice mindfulness, our thoughts tune into what we’re sensing in the present moment rather than rehashing the past or imagining the future.Moran, Joan; University of California at Los Angeles, http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/gratitude-249167</div> <div class="para">Anything that keeps you present in the moment and gives your prefrontal cortex (the reasoning and thinking part of your brain) a break is practicing mindfulness. Mindfulness can be a slow walk; looking intently at the grass, trees, flowers, or buildings; and being aware of what you are sensing and feeling. Mindfulness can be sitting quietly—even sitting still in a quiet place for as little as a few minutes can reduce heart rate and blood pressure.The Greater Good Science Center, UC Berkeley https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/</div> <div class="para">Developing a practice of mindfulness is easier than you may think:</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Slow down.</em> From brushing your teeth, to washing your face, to shampooing your hair—can you take the speed out of getting ready in the morning? Focus on the activity, pay attention to what you are doing, stay present (this means don’t think about what happened last night or what’s in store for the day, just stay focused on the activity), and take your time.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Focus on your breath.</em> How fast are you breathing? Is your breath coming from your chest or your belly? Can you feel the air come through your nose on the inhale? Can you slow down the exhale? Can you feel your body relax when you slow the exhale?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Connect to your environment.</em> Walk for a few minutes, focused on the world around you—look at the leaves on the trees or the light at the corner, listen to the sounds around you, stay with your surroundings, and observe what you see and hear around you.</div></li>
</ul></div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">“We can’t change the world, at least not quickly, but we can change our brains. By practicing mindfulness all of us have the capacity to develop a deeper sense of calm.”</em></div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">— Rick Hanson, author, Resilient</em></div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Deep Breathing.</span></h4> <div class="para">When people hear mindfulness they often think meditation. While meditation is one method of mindfulness, there are many others that may be simpler and easier for you to practice. Deep breathing helps lower stress and reduce anxiety, and it is simple yet very powerful. A daily mindful breathing practice has been shown to reduce test anxiety in college students.Levitin, Time Special Edition 2018, The New Mindfulness A 2-4-6-8 breathing pattern is a very useful tool that can be used to help bring a sense of calm and to help mild to moderate anxiety. It takes almost no time, requires no equipment, and can be done anywhere:</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Start by quickly exhaling any air in your lungs (to the count of 2).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Breathing in through your nose, inhale to the count of 4.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Hold your breath for a count of 6.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Slowly exhale through your mouth to the count of 8.</div></li>
</ul></div> <div class="para">This is one round. Do not repeat the quick exhale again. Instead start round two with an inhale through your nose to the count of 4, hold for 6, and exhale to 8. Repeat for three more rounds to relax your body and mind.</div> <div class="para">With practice, 2-4-6-8 breathing will become a useful tool for times when you experience tension or stress.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Meditation.</span></h4> <div class="para">Dan Harris, a news reporter at ABC, fell into drug use and suffered a major panic attack on national television. Following this embarrassing period in his life, he learned to meditate and found that it made him calmer and more resilient. He’s now on a mission to make meditation approachable to everyone. Dan used to be a skeptic about meditation but now says that if he learned to meditate, anyone can learn to meditate! Dan reminds us that we ARE going to get lost, and our mind IS going to stray, and that’s ok. Simply notice when you’re lost and start over. Every time your mind strays and your start over, it is like a bicep curl for your brain. Start with 3 minutes and slowly work your way up to 15 or 20. <a class="external" href="https://openstax.org/l/danharris" target="_blank">To hear more about Dan’s journey, watch this video</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-13-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a>, and for a simple meditation to get started, you can try one of the videos on the <a class="external" href="https://openstax.org/l/meditation" target="_blank">meditation Youtube channel</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-14-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a>.</div> <div class="para">Some great meditation apps include Insight Timer, CALM, and Headspace.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Gratitude.</span></h4> <div class="para">Too often people think it is the external factors that bring us joy and happiness, when really it’s all related to internal work. According to UCLA’s Mindfulness Awareness Research Center, “Having an attitude of gratitude changes the molecular structure of the brain, and makes us healthier and happier. When you feel happiness, the central nervous system is affected. You are more peaceful, less reactive and less resistant.”2016 Study Journal of PLoS One, https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316</div> <div class="para">Numerous studies show that people who count their blessings tend to be happier and less depressed. In a UC Berkeley study, researchers recruited 300 people who were experiencing emotional or mental health challenges and randomly divided them into three groups. All three groups received counseling services. The first group also wrote a letter of gratitude every week for three weeks. The second group wrote about their thoughts and feelings with negative experiences. The third group received only counseling. The people in the group who wrote gratitude letters reported significantly better mental health for up to 12 weeks after the writing exercise ended.</div> <div class="para">This would suggest that a healthy emotional self-care practice is to take note of good experiences or when you see something that makes you smile. Think about why the experience feels so good. According to Rick Hanson, author of <em class="emphasis">Resilient</em>, “Each day is strewn with little jewels. The idea is to see them and pick them up. When you notice something positive, stay with the feeling for 30 seconds. Feel the emotions in your whole body. Maybe your heart feels lighter or you’re smiling. The more you can deepen and lengthen positive experiences the longer those positivity neurons in your brain are firing—and the longer they fire the stronger the underlying neural networks become. Repeat that process a half dozen times a day and you’ll feel stronger, more stable and calmer within a few weeks.”<span class="process-math">\(\)</span>
