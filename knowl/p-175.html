<div class="para">Another way to look at learning is through the biological lens. When we go through <dfn class="terminology">the learning process</dfn> outlined above, our brains actually change. This is called <em class="emphasis">neuroplasticity</em>, or the brainâ€™s ability to form or reorganize neural pathways in reaction to the learning process. This means that when you learn something new, and especially if you practice it and fail at getting it right the first time, your brain is changing. When you get better at a skill such as throwing a curve ball or learning how to solve for X, your brain is actually reorganizing itself so that you can perform those tasks more quickly.</div>
