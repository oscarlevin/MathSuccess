<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Make Certain You Understand the Requirements of Each Task.</span></h4> <div class="para">One of the best ways to make good decisions about the prioritization of tasks is to understand the requirements of each. If you have multiple assignments to complete and you assume one of those assignments will only take an hour, you may decide to put it off until the others are finished. Your assumption could be disastrous if you find, once you begin the assignment, that there are several extra components that you did not account for and the time to complete will be four times as long as you estimated. Or, one of the assignments may be dependent on the results of anotherâ€”like participating in a study and then writing a report on the results. If you are not aware that one assignment depends upon the completion of the other before you begin, you could inadvertently do the assignments out of order and have to start over. Because of situations like this, it is critically important to understand exactly what needs to be done to complete a task before you determine its priority.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-time-manage.html#paragraphs-71" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
