<em class="emphasis">The relationships you build with your professors will be some of the most important ones you create during your college career</em>. You will rely on them to help you find internships, write letters of recommendation, nominate you for honors or awards, and serve as references for jobs. You can develop those relationships by participating in class, visiting during office hours, asking for assistance with coursework, requesting recommendations for courses and majors, and getting to know the professorâ€™s own academic interests.</div>
