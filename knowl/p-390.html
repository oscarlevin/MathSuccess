<div class="para">Test anxiety, however, can cause us to doubt ourselves so severely that we underperform or overcompensate to the point that we do not do well on the exam. Don’t despair; you can still succeed if you suffer from test anxiety. The first step is to understand what it is and what it is not, and then to practice some simple strategies to cope with your anxious feelings relative to test taking. Whatever you do, don’t use the label <em class="emphasis">test anxiety</em> to keep you from your dreams of completing your education and pursuing whatever career you have your eyes on. You are bigger than any anxiety.</div>
