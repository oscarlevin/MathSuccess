<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Pomodoro Technique.</span></h3>       <div class="para">The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo. The basic concept is to use a timer to set work intervals that are followed by a short break. The intervals are usually about 25 minutes long and are called <em class="emphasis">pomodoros</em>, which comes from the Italian word for tomato because Cirillo used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to keep track of the intervals.</div> <div class="para">In the original technique there are six steps:</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Decide on the task to be done.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Set the timer to the desired interval.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Work on the task.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">When the timer goes off, put a check mark on a piece of paper.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If you have fewer than four check marks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to Step 1 or 2 (whichever is appropriate).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your check mark count to zero, and then go to Step 1 or 2.</div></li>
</ol></div>       <div class="para">There are several reasons this technique is deemed effective for many people. One is the benefit that is derived from quick cycles of work and short breaks. This helps reduce mental fatigue and the lack of productivity caused by it. Another is that it tends to encourage practitioners to break tasks down to things that can be completed in about 25 minutes, which is something that is usually manageable from the perspective of time available. It is much easier to squeeze in three 25-minute sessions of work time during the day than it is to set aside a 75- minute block of time.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-time-manage.html#paragraphs-85" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
