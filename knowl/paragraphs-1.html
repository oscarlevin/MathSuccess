<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">College Has Its Own Language and Customs.</span></h3> <div class="para">Going to college—even if you are not far from home—is a cultural experience. It comes with its own language and customs, some of which can be confusing or confounding at first. Just like traveling to a foreign country, it is best if you prepare by learning what words mean and what you are expected to say and do in certain situations.</div> <div class="para">Let’s first start with the language you may encounter. In most cases, there will be words that you have heard before, but they may have different meanings in a college setting. Take, for instance, “student hours” which are also commonly called “office hours”. If you are not in college, you might think that “office hours” means the hours of a day that an office is open. If it is your dentist’s office, it may mean Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. In college, “student/office hours” can refer to the specific hours a professor is in her office to meet with students, and those hours may be only a few each day: for example, Mondays and Wednesdays from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m.</div> <div class="para">“Syllabus” is another word that you may not have encountered, but it is one you will soon know very well. A syllabus is often called the “contract of the course” because it contains information about what to expect—from the professor and the student. It is meant to be a roadmap for succeeding in the class. Understanding that student/office hours are for you to ask your professor questions and the syllabus is the guide for what you will be doing in the class can make a big difference in your transition to college. The table on Common <dfn class="terminology">College Terms</dfn>, below, has a brief list of other words that you will want to know when you hear them on campus (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/m00004-ch01tab07.html" title="Table 1.1.1: Common College Terms, What They Mean, and Why You Need to Know">Table 1.1.1</a>).</div> <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.1.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Common College Terms, What They Mean, and Why You Need to Know</figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">

</table></div></figure> <div class="para">In addition to its own language, higher education has its own way of doing things. For example, you may be familiar with what a high school teacher does, but do you know what a professor does? It certainly seems like they fulfill a very similar role as teachers in high school, but in college, professors’ roles are often much more diverse. In addition to teaching, they may also conduct research, mentor graduate students, write and review research articles, serve on and lead campus committees, serve in regional and national organizations in their disciplines, apply for and administer grants, advise students in their major, and serve as sponsors for student organizations. You can be assured that their days are far from routine.

<em class="emphasis">The relationships you build with your professors will be some of the most important ones you create during your college career</em>. You will rely on them to help you find internships, write letters of recommendation, nominate you for honors or awards, and serve as references for jobs. You can develop those relationships by participating in class, visiting during office hours, asking for assistance with coursework, requesting recommendations for courses and majors, and getting to know the professor’s own academic interests.</div> <div class="para">In college, your networks are going to expand in ways that will help you develop other aspects of yourself. Your relationships will expand to peer networks—not friends, but near-age peers or situational peers (e.g., a first-year college student who is going back to school after being out for 20 years)—and to faculty and staff who may work alongside you, mentor you, or supervise your studies. These relationships are important because they will allow you to expand your network, especially as it relates to your career. As stated earlier, developing relationships with faculty can provide you with more than just the benefits of a mentor. Faculty often review applications for on-campus jobs or university scholarships and awards; they also have connections with graduate programs, companies, and organizations. They may recommend you to colleagues or former classmates for internships and even jobs.</div> <div class="para">Other differences between high school and college are included below. Because it is not an exhaustive list of the differences, be mindful of other differences you may notice. Also, if your most recent experience has been the world of work or the military, you may find that there are more noticeable differences between those experiences and college.</div> <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.1.3<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Differences Between High School and College</figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">
