<em class="emphasis">Worry about making a mistake.</em> This concern often goes with imposter syndrome. Students who worry about making a mistake don’t like to answer questions in class, volunteer for a challenging assignment, and even ask for help from others. Instead of avoiding situations where you may fail, embrace the process of learning, which includes—is even dependent on—making mistakes. The more you practice courage in these situations and focus on what you are going to learn from failing, the more confident you become about your abilities.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-hidden-curriculum.html#li-37" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
