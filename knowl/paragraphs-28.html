Bruce TuckmanTuckman, Bruce W (1965). “Developmental sequence in small groups”. Psychological Bulletin. <em class="emphasis">63</em> (6): 384–399. doi:10.1037/h0022100. PMID 14314073. (1965) developed a model of group development. His initial four phases are forming, storming, norming and performing. In the <em class="emphasis">forming</em> phase, group members learn more about the task they must complete as well as getting to know each other. For the most part, members act and think individually and may be polite or quiet when trying to make decisions about what needs to be done. Group conflict arises in the <em class="emphasis">storming</em> phase when roles are assigned and a leader emerges. Some members may not voice their concerns and suffer from internal (and unexpressed) conflict while others may openly argue about what needs to be done. Groups may skip this phase altogether if communication is clear and roles are assigned to interest and strengths. The next phase is <em class="emphasis">norming</em>, or when group members work collectively to help each other achieve their goal. Members are aware of how their part fits into the whole and are mindful of supporting each other. The last phase is <em class="emphasis">performing</em> and is marked by members’ competence and confidence to complete goals.</div> <div class="para">Some groups revert to previous phases when there is unresolved conflict or when communication breaks down. The goal of group work is not to have a conflict-free experience, but to learn how to negotiate challenges, concerns, and changes during the process. When group members set common goals, create clear expectations, and communicate regularly, they are less likely to experience insurmountable obstacles.</div> </section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-class-engage.html#paragraphs-28" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
