<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Note-Taking Strategies.</span></h3> <div class="para">You may have a standard way you take all your notes for all your classes. When you were in high school, this one-size-fits-all approach may have worked. Now that you’re in college, reading and studying more advanced topics, your general method may still work some of the time, but you should have some different strategies in place if you find that your method isn’t working as well with college content. You probably will need to adopt different note-taking strategies for different subjects. The strategies in this section represent various ways to take notes in such a way that you are able to study after the initial note-taking session.</div> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Cornell Method.</span></h4> <div class="para">One of the most recognizable note-taking systems is called the <em class="emphasis">Cornell Method</em>, a relatively simple way to take effective notes devised by Cornell University education professor Dr. Walter Pauk in the 1940s. In this system, you take a standard piece of note paper and divide it into three sections by drawing a horizontal line across your paper about one to two inches from the bottom of the page (the summary area) and then drawing a vertical line to separate the rest of the page above this bottom area, making the left side about two inches (the recall column) and leaving the biggest area to the right of your vertical line (the notes column). You may want to make one page and then copy as many pages as you think you’ll need for any particular class, but one advantage of this system is that you can generate the sections quickly. Because you have divided up your page, you may end up using more paper than you would if you were writing on the entire page, but the point is not to keep your notes to as few pages as possible. The Cornell Method provides you with a well-organized set of notes that will help you study and review your notes as you move through the course. If you are taking notes on your computer, you can still use the Cornell Method in Word or Excel on your own or by using a template someone else created.</div>       <div class="para">Now that you have the note-taking format generated, the beauty of the Cornell Method is its organized simplicity. Just write on one side of the page (the right-hand notes column)—this will help later when you are reviewing and revising your notes. During your note-taking session, use the notes column to record information over the main points and concepts of the lecture; try to put the ideas into your own words, which will help you to not transcribe the speaker’s words verbatim. Skip lines between each idea in this column.</div> <div class="para">Practice the shortcut abbreviations covered in the next section and avoid writing in complete sentences. Don’t make your notes too cryptic, but you can use bullet points or phrases equally well to convey meaning—we do it all the time in conversation. If you know you will need to expand the notes you are taking in class but don’t have time, you can put reminders directly in the notes by adding and underlining the word <em class="emphasis">expand</em> by the ideas you need to develop more fully.</div> <div class="para">As soon as possible after your note-taking session, preferably within eight hours but no more than twenty-four hours, read over your notes column and fill in any details you missed in class, including the places where you indicated you wanted to expand your notes. Then in the recall column, write any key ideas from the corresponding notes column—you can’t stuff this smaller recall column as if you’re explaining or defining key ideas. Just add the one- or two-word main ideas; these words in the recall column serve as cues to help you remember the detailed information you recorded in the notes column.</div> <div class="para">Once you are satisfied with your notes and recall columns, summarize this page of notes in two or three sentences using the summary area at the bottom of the sheet. This is an excellent time to get with another classmate or a group of students who all heard the same lecture to make sure you all understood the key points. Now, before you move onto something else, cover the large notes column, and quiz yourself over the key ideas you recorded in the recall column. Repeat this step often as you go along, not just immediately before an exam, and you will help your memory make the connections between your notes, your textbook reading, your in-class work, and assignments that you need to succeed on any quizzes and exams.</div>       <div class="para">The main advantage of the Cornell Method is that you are setting yourself up to have organized, workable notes. The neat format helps you move into study-mode without needing to re-copy less organized notes or making sense of a large mass of information you aren’t sure how to process because you can’t remember key ideas or what you meant. If you write notes in your classes without any sort of system and later come across something like “Napoleon—short” in the middle of a glob of notes, what can you do at this point? Is that important? Did it connect with something relevant from the lecture? How would you possibly know? You are your best advocate for setting yourself up for success in college.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Outlining.</span></h4> <div class="para">Other note organizing systems may help you in different disciplines. You can take notes in a formal outline if you prefer, using Roman numerals for each new topic, moving down a line to capital letters indented a few spaces to the right for concepts related to the previous topic, then adding details to support the concepts indented a few more spaces over and denoted by an Arabic numeral. You can continue to add to a formal outline by following these rules.</div> <div class="para">You don’t absolutely have to use the formal numerals and letter, but you have to then be careful to indent so you can tell when you move from a higher level topic to the related concepts and then to the supporting information. The main benefit of an outline is how organized it is. You have to be on your toes when you are taking notes in class to ensure you keep up the organizational format of the outline, which can be tricky if the lecture or presentation is moving quickly or covering many diverse topics.</div> <div class="para">The following formal outline example shows the basic pattern:</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Dogs <em class="emphasis">(main topic–usually general)</em> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">German Shepherd <em class="emphasis">(concept related to main topic)</em> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-roman">
<li><div class="para">Protection <em class="emphasis">(supporting info about the concept)</em>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Assertive</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Loyal</div></li>
</ol></div>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Weimaraner <em class="emphasis">(concept related to main topic)</em> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-roman">
<li><div class="para">Family-friendly <em class="emphasis">(supporting info about the concept)</em>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Active</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Healthy</div></li>
</ol></div>
</div></li>
</ol></div>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Cats <em class="emphasis">(main topic)</em> <div class="para">Siamese</div>
</div></li>
</ol></div> <div class="para">You would just continue on with this sort of numbering and indenting format to show the connections between main ideas, concepts, and supporting details. Whatever details you do not capture in your note-taking session, you can add after the lecture as you review your outline.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Chart or Table.</span></h4> <div class="para">Similar to creating an outline, you can develop a chart to compare and contrast main ideas in a note-taking session. Divide your paper into four or five columns with headings that include either the main topics covered in the lecture or categories such as How?, What?, When used?, Advantages/Pros, Disadvantages/Cons, or other divisions of the information. You write your notes into the appropriate columns as that information comes to light in the presentation. The table below provides an example of a table that can help you organize topics in a science course.</div> <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">2.3.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">

</table></div></figure> <div class="para">This format helps you pull out the salient ideas and establishes an organized set of notes to study later. (If you haven’t noticed that this <em class="emphasis">reviewing later</em> idea is a constant across all note-taking systems, you should take note of that.) Notes by themselves that you never reference again are little more than scribblings. That would be a bit like compiling an extensive grocery list so you stay on budget when you shop, work all week on it, and then just throw it away before you get to the store. You may be able to recall a few items, but likely won’t be as efficient as you could be if you had the notes to reference. Just as you cannot read all the many books, articles, and documents you need to peruse for your college classes, you cannot remember the most important ideas of all the notes you will take as part of your courses, so you must review.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Concept Mapping and Visual Note-Taking.</span></h4> <div class="para">One final note-taking method that appeals to learners who prefer a visual representation of notes is called <em class="emphasis">mapping</em> or sometimes <em class="emphasis">mind mapping</em> or <em class="emphasis">concept mapping,</em> although each of these names can have slightly different uses. Variations of this method abound, so you may want to look for more versions online, but the basic principles are that you are making connections between main ideas through a graphic depiction; some can get rather elaborate with colors and shapes, but a simple version may be more useful at least to begin. Main ideas can be circled or placed in a box with supporting concepts radiating off these ideas shown with a connecting line and possibly details of the support further radiating off the concepts. You can present your main ideas vertically or horizontally, but turning your paper long-ways, or in landscape mode, may prove helpful as you add more main ideas.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/../m00016/../../media/CS_Figure_03_04_012.jpg" class="contained" alt="A concept map shows a glob of student’s notes using connectors, bubbles, lists, symbols, and different colors."></div>

Sometimes when you can’t come up with the exact wording to explain something or you’re trying to add information for complex ideas in your notes, sketching a rough image of the idea can help you remember. According to educator Sherrill Knezel in an article entitled “The Power of Visual Note-taking,” this strategy is effective because “When students use images and text in note-taking, it gives them two different ways to pull up the information, doubling their chances of recall.” Don’t shy away from this creative approach to note-taking just because you believe you aren’t an artist; the images don’t need to be perfect. You may want to watch <a class="external" href="https://openstax.org/l/drawinginclass" target="_blank">Rachel Smith’s TEDx Talk called “Drawing in Class”</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.3.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> to learn more about visual note-taking.</div> <div class="para">You can play with different types of note-taking suggestions and find the method(s) you like best, but once you find what works for you, stick with it. You will become more efficient with the method the more you use it, and your note-taking, review, and test prep will become, if not easier, certainly more organized, which can decrease your anxiety.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Practicing Decipherable Shorthand.</span></h4> <div class="para">Most college students don’t take a class in shorthand, once the domain of secretaries and executive assistants, but maybe they should. That almost-lost art in the age of computers could come in very handy during intense note-taking sessions. Elaborate shorthand systems do exist, but you would be better served in your college note-taking adventures to hone a more familiar, personalized form of shorthand to help you write more in a shorter amount of time. Seemingly insignificant shortcuts can add up to ease the stress note-taking can induce—especially if you ever encounter an “I’m not going to repeat this” kind of presenter! Become familiar with these useful abbreviations:</div> <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">2.3.3<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">
