<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Prioritizing Time Surrounding Test Situations.</span></h4> <div class="para">Keep in mind that you don’t have any more or less time than anyone else, so you can’t <em class="emphasis">make time</em> for an activity. You can only use the time everyone gets wisely and realistically. Exams in college classes are important, but they are not the only significant events you have in your classes. In fact, everything leading up to the exam, the exam itself, and the post-exam activities are all one large continuum. Think of the exam as an event with multiple phases, more like a long-distance run instead of a 50-yard dash. Step back and look at the big picture of this timeline. Draw it out on paper. What needs to happen between now and the exam so you feel comfortable, confident, and ready?</div> <div class="para">If your instructor conducts some sort of pre-exam summary or prep session, make sure to attend. These can be invaluable. If this instructor does not provide that sort of formal exam prep, create your own with a group of classmates or on your own. Consider everything you know about the exam, from written instructions to notes you took in class, including any experiential notes you may have from previous exams, such as the possibility of bonus points for answering an extra question that requires some time management on your part. You can read more about time management in Chapter 3.</div> </section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-test-take.html#paragraphs-45" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
