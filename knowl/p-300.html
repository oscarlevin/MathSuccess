<div class="para">Next, your group should determine roles. You may want to first determine the leader, or you may decide to share leadership between two members or choose a “second in command” should the leader not be able to fulfill the duties. Then, you will need to set roles and responsibilities for everyone else in the group. Be sure to discuss each other’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Different types of group projects call for different roles, so you may need to pick and choose what is appropriate for your project. <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "table-00003" missing or not unique]</code> provides examples of roles and responsibilities that you may consider when assigning roles.</div>
