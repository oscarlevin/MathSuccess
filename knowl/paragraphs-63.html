<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Stress.</span></h4> <div class="para">Procrastination causes stress and anxiety, which may seem odd since the act of procrastination is often about avoiding a task we think will be stressful in itself! Anyone who has noticed that nagging feeling when they know there is something else they should be doing is familiar with this.</div> <div class="para">On the other hand, some students see that kind of stress as a boost of mental urgency. They put off a task until they feel that surge of motivation. While this may have worked in the past, they quickly learn that procrastinating when it comes to college work almost always includes an underestimation of the tasks to be completedâ€” sometimes with disastrous results.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-time-manage.html#paragraphs-63" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
