<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Be Accountable.</span></h4> <div class="para">A strong motivational tool is to hold ourselves accountable by telling someone else we are going to do something and when we are going to do it. This may not seem like it would be very effective, but on a psychological level we feel more compelled to do something if we tell someone else. It may be related to our need for approval from others, or it might just serve to set a level of commitment. Either way, it can help us stay on task and avoid procrastinationâ€”especially if we take our accountability to another person seriously enough to warrant contacting that person and apologizing for not doing what we said we were going to do.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-time-manage.html#paragraphs-68" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
