<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Setting Up Your Group for Success.</span></h3> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Review Assignment.</span></h4> <div class="para">If we use the Tuckman (1965) model, we can anticipate the steps for creating a successful group. First, review the assignment and ensure that everyone understands the scope of the work, especially the expectations of the final product. Take some time to discuss what the parts of the assignment are and what the expected outcome should be. Will you be writing a paper? Will you be presenting original research? Will you need special equipment, technology, or software to complete the project? Get clarity on the assignment before you get too far into the work.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Choose Roles.</span></h4> <div class="para">Next, your group should determine roles. You may want to first determine the leader, or you may decide to share leadership between two members or choose a “second in command” should the leader not be able to fulfill the duties. Then, you will need to set roles and responsibilities for everyone else in the group. Be sure to discuss each other’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Different types of group projects call for different roles, so you may need to pick and choose what is appropriate for your project. <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "table-00003" missing or not unique]</code> provides examples of roles and responsibilities that you may consider when assigning roles.</div> <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">2.4.2<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">

Because college students have different schedules and obligations, you will find that a strong communication plan can make working together easier. You may find that you need to work asynchronously, or not at the same time, and clear communication expectations will help your group both in person and online run smoothly. Here are some questions to guide your communication plan:</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">How will the group communicate primarily?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What will be the back-up communication strategy?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What will you do if a group member doesn’t respond to or acknowledge messages?</div></li>
</ul></div> <div class="para">If group members do not want to share personal phone numbers, then consider using email or a shared drive folder to message each other.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Write a Group Contract.</span></h4> <div class="para">To ensure that all members uphold their responsibilities, create a contract that lists all the expectations for the group. You can use a template or create your own based on the group members’ roles, dynamics, and assignment requirements. A group contract can be helpful in managing conflict and directing group members should someone not do their part. Here are the components you will want to consider and an example below of a contract:</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Assignment reminders.</em> Include a description of the goal or project and the final deadline.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">General expectations or guiding principles.</em> Provide a list of general expectations or principles that will guide a successful group. For example, you may determine that acting respectfully, communicating honestly, and giving full effort are important group principles.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Specific expectations or tasks.</em> List expectations about communicating, delegating, meeting, completing tasks, and managing conflict.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Group members’ signatures.</em> Include signatures or initials of the group members to underscore the importance of the contract.</div></li>
