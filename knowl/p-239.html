<div class="para">One final note-taking method that appeals to learners who prefer a visual representation of notes is called <em class="emphasis">mapping</em> or sometimes <em class="emphasis">mind mapping</em> or <em class="emphasis">concept mapping,</em> although each of these names can have slightly different uses. Variations of this method abound, so you may want to look for more versions online, but the basic principles are that you are making connections between main ideas through a graphic depiction; some can get rather elaborate with colors and shapes, but a simple version may be more useful at least to begin. Main ideas can be circled or placed in a box with supporting concepts radiating off these ideas shown with a connecting line and possibly details of the support further radiating off the concepts. You can present your main ideas vertically or horizontally, but turning your paper long-ways, or in landscape mode, may prove helpful as you add more main ideas.</div>
