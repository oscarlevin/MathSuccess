    <title>Student Survey</title>
    <p>How confident are you in preparing for and taking tests? Take this quick survey to figure it out, ranking questions on a scale of 1—4, 1 meaning “least like me” and 4 meaning “most like me.” These questions will help you determine how the chapter concepts relate to you right now. As you are introduced to new concepts and practices, it can be informative to reflect on how your understanding changes over time.</p>
    <p>
      <ol xml:id="m00017-list-00001">
        <li>
          <p>I set aside enough time to prepare for tests.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If I don’t set aside enough time, or if life gets in the way, I can usually cram and get positive results.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>I prefer to pull all-nighters. The adrenaline and urgency help me remember what I need come test time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>I study my notes, highlight book passages, and use flash cards, but I still don’t feel like I’m as successful as I should be on tests.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

    <p>[[NOTE]]</p>
    <p>Deep learning is the long-term goal of college students, especially when they start taking classes in their major or that directly connect to their career field. However, deep learning doesn’t happen overnight. After you have read the texts and listened to the lectures, you will want to participate in activities that help you move your understanding from your short-term memory to your long-term memory. And there is only one way to learn deeply: through effective study practices and test taking in which you receive feedback on how well you have learned.</p>

    <title>About This Chapter</title>
    <p>By the time you finish this chapter, you should be able to do the following:</p>
    <p>
      <ul xml:id="m00017-list-00002">
        <li>
          <p>Describe the key components of deep learning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Outline the importance of memory when studying and note some opportunities to strengthen memory.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Discuss specific ways to increase the effectiveness of studying.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Articulate test-taking strategies that minimize anxiety and maximize results.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Discuss the role that metacognition plays in the learning process.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>It makes sense that the better you are at studying and test taking, the better results you’ll see in the form of high grades and long-term learning and knowledge acquisition. And the more experience you have using your study and memorization skills and employing success strategies during exams, the better you’ll get at it. But you have to keep it up—maintaining these skills and learning better strategies as the content you study becomes increasingly complex is crucial to your success. Once you transition into a work environment, you will be able to use these same skills that helped you to be successful in college as you face the problem-solving demands and expectations of your job. Earning high grades is one goal, and certainly a good one when you’re in college, but true learning means committing content to long-term memory.</p>
