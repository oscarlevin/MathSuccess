    <title>About This Chapter</title>
    <p>Deciding to go to college can be an exciting and nerve-wracking time. Will you be able to balance your high school work and activities with the process of applying to college? Will you find a school that you want to go to? Will you be able to afford it? Will you make new friends and feel comfortable there? How far away from home will you be and will a new community feel welcoming? All of the thoughts and the accompanying emotions will come and go as you move through high school and towards making a decision as to what you want to do after earning a diploma. Be assured that you can complete the requirements for getting through high school <m>and</m> plan for setting yourself on the pathway to what we call “postsecondary” education, or the training program or college that you attend after you complete the 12th grade or earn a general education diploma (GED).</p>
    <p>In this chapter, you will learn about the purpose of a college education, the process of applying to college and what you need to think about to make the most of the time you have now to prepare yourself. By the time you complete this chapter, you should be able to do the following:</p>
