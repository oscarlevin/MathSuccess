          <p>What is metacognition?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>What contributes to poor metacognition?</p>

      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Consider this scenario: Marcus has studied for his chemistry test by rereading the chapters and looking at his notes. He has spent several hours the night before doing this and feels ready for the test. The concepts are not particularly difficult, but there is a lot to recall. When he takes the test, he feels pretty confident that he has earned at least an 80% (B). He isn’t able to answer all the questions—and knows he could have studied longer—but he feels comfortable with his performance. When he gets the test back, he is surprised to learn he has earned a 54% (F). He has now realized that he didn’t really understand the material well enough to answer the types of questions his professor included. <em>What happened to Marcus and what can he do differently next time?</em></p>
    <p>Deep learning, as described earlier in the chapter, is the goal you should be striving for in most if not all of your college classes. The learning process starts with taking in information—through reading, listening, or doing—organizing it in your brain for quick recall or use, and then demonstrating, usually through a test or assignment, that you know the information. However, learning doesn’t end there. As you learn and demonstrate your knowledge, you will receive feedback to help you adjust your learning strategies or reflect the level of learning that has occurred.</p>
    <p>Feedback can include the following:</p>
    <p>
      <ul xml:id="m00022-list-00002">
        <li>
          <p>A grade on a test in which you can see what questions you got right and what you got wrong.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Written feedback from an instructor or peer about what you have done well and what can be improved.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Immediate feedback on a skill (such as playing a note on an instrument) that indicates you did it correctly or not.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The ease or difficulty at which you can recall or explain information that you are learning.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>This feedback is what you need to help you develop <em><em>metacognition</em>,</em> which is the awareness of your own learning processes. When you have good metacognition, you can determine what you know and don’t know. You are also able to adjust your learning strategies to improve. Without this feedback, whether it is formal (e.g., a test grade) or informal (you stumble over defining terms), you will have more difficulty improving your awareness.</p>
    <p>In Marcus’ case, he had poor metacognition because his study strategy, rereading the text and his notes and studying the night before, did not provide him with feedback on what he knew well and what he didn’t. In fact, what Marcus did produced <em><em>fluency illusion</em>,</em> which is the belief that you know something better than you really do. This fluency illusion occurred because he reread the material and that made him confident that he knew the content. However, Marcus had poor metacognition. Now that Marcus has more feedback from his test, he can use that information to help him determine why he failed to learn the content well enough for the test.</p>
    <p>Here are the steps for improving your metacognition so that you can adjust your thinking and study strategies for maximum benefit:</p>
    <p>
      <ul xml:id="m00022-list-00003">
        <li>
          <p>Choose a study strategy or a combination of them such as the ones described in this chapter, but be sure to include testing yourself (e.g., practice tests, teaching someone else, trying to rewrite notes from memory).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>As you study, track what you are able to recall easily and what you still struggle with and focus on those areas.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Take the test, complete the assignment, or perform the skill.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Review the feedback you receive and examine it for what went well and what didn’t.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Make adjustments to your study strategies before the next assessment.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>This feedback loop in which you use that information to make changes is <em>essential</em> to learning. If you don’t look at the grade or feedback and hope to “work harder” next time, you likely won’t be using the specific, effective, efficient learning strategies that could make a difference in the outcome and your grade.</p>

    <title>Friends &amp; Family Matter</title>
    <p>Michael’s recently failed test in calculus has rocked his confidence, especially since he has begun to doubt his abilities. While Michael was a good student—As and Bs—in high school, he was initially concerned that he was not ready for the academic expectations of college. This grade made this concern more real.</p>
    <p>When Michael was in high school, his parents expected that he would never fail any assignment or any course. On the few occasions that he brought home a C or D on an assignment, they would ground him until he raised his grades. He believed he would not be ready for college if he did less than quality work. One time, his parents had a meeting with his high school biology teacher about his progress. They have been involved and concerned about his grades because they wanted the best from and for him.</p>
    <p>Now that Michael is away from home and doesn’t need to share his grades, he feels uncertain about how to deal with this experience. He knows that his parents cannot contact his professors about his grades, so he doesn’t feel obligated to tell them everything just yet, especially because he has the opportunity to raise his grade in calculus. However, he wants to be honest about what has happened, especially if he cannot raise his grade before the end of the semester and needs to drop the course. He doesn’t want to surprise them with the information.</p>
    <subsection xml:id="m00022-sect-00003">
      <title>Let’s Think About It</title>
      <p>Michael has several options. Think through the consequences of each one, and choose the best option or create your own option.</p>
      <p>
        <ul xml:id="m00022-list-00005">
          <li>
            <p>Michael chooses not to share this failing grade with his family, so they are not aware of any of his struggles.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Michael shares his failing grade although he thinks it will cause undue stress with his family, and he will have to hear a lecture about not being ready for college.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Michael talks with his professor and a tutor about a plan to improve his studying and grades, and shares with his family what happened and how he plans to make changes.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <title>Let’s Talk About It</title>
      <p>Michael is not obligated to share his grades with his family unless he feels some obligation or has made a clear commitment to keeping them updated on his progress. Some families make a pact that they will continue to provide support when they see each term’s transcripts. Here are some suggestions for communicating with others about the dilemma that Michael is facing:
</p>
      <p>
        <ul xml:id="m00022-list-00006">
          <li>
            <p>“I wanted to let you know that I failed a test in my calculus class recently. I don’t want you to be alarmed—many in the class messed up on the first test—but I don’t want you to be surprised if I have to spend more time bringing this grade up. I have a plan and feel confident I can improve.”</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>“I recently struggled on a test because I was overconfident and slacked off. I realize that now and have talked with the professor about what to do differently. He assured me that it was normal and not an indication that I won’t be successful.”</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>“Most of my classes are going well and my grades are good, but I did have a test that I failed. I was surprised, but I realized that I had not prepared appropriately and since then I have met with a tutor and have started studying for the next test now. I even went to see my professor to check my understanding and he confirmed I was studying better.”</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <p>Whatever choice you would make in this situation, it is always best to communicate clearly your needs, your concerns, and even your uncertainties.</p>

    <title>Summary and Next Steps to College Success</title>
    <p>Deepening your learning happens when you study effectively and prepare adequately for taking tests. Learning how to do these well can only help you be more successful. Additionally, this chapter discusses the role that metacognition plays in helping you improve your learning processes. This chapter has provided a variety of tools, strategies, tips and information about how to develop skills that will be most effective for your experience. You can help yourself by taking these guidelines seriously and tracking your progress. If one strategy works better for you in some classes and another is more suited to a different course, keep that in mind when you begin to study. Use all the resources available to you, and you’ll be well on your way to success in college.</p>
    <p>Studying and test taking skills often need to evolve to meet the needs of college expectations. Even if you have solid skills your first year, you will need to continue to develop, hone, and add to them. To that end, consider what else about developing your memory, honing your study strategies, practicing good test-taking skills, or improving your metacognition you would like to learn or practice.
