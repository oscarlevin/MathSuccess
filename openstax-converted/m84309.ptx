  <title>Recommended Readings</title>
  <p>No list of this nature can be all-inclusive, so read online summaries and ask around before you devote time and effort to resources related to thinking. Even a bad book can teach valuable lessons (such as how to be more selective), but you also don’t want to waste your limited time.</p>

        <p><em>Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking</em> by Malcolm Gladwell. Gladwell, a writer for the <em>New Yorker</em> magazine, presents the science of thinking on the fly—how some people are better than others at sifting through all the available information and only accessing what matters most in making important decisions. It may appear that these “gut reactions” are instantaneous, but Gladwell argues that a great deal of thinking goes into these seemingly snap decisions. </p>
