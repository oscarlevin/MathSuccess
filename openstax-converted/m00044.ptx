      <p> All OpenStax textbooks undergo a rigorous review process.
          However, like any professional-grade textbook, errors sometimes occur. Since our books are

    <title>About <em>College Success Concise</em></title>
    <p><em>College Success Concise</em> is designed to meet the course
        needs of a variety of courses, workshops, or seminars for first-year experience or college
        transition students. FYE programs vary greatly according to institution, so this briefer
        version of the original <em>College Success</em> textbook has
        been developed to provide the most flexibility possible for course coordinators,
        instructors, and instructional designers. The open license and multiple formats provide many
        opportunities to tailor the material to meet program-specific needs.</p>
    <p><em>College Success</em> and <em>College
        Success Concise</em> address the evolving challenges and opportunities of today's
        diverse students. The intensive development work leveraged expertise from hundreds of FYE
        coordinators and faculty across the country. In particular, this Concise version was crafted
        with the input of dozens of course coordinators and faculty who used the original text in a
        variety of contexts, including one-credit seminars and summer bridge programs. The topics
        have been carefully chosen to prioritize the most critical topics in those briefer course
        offerings, and the authors have organized them to create a logical and reinforcing flow.
        While much of the material is very similar to the original <em>College
        Success</em> book, this version was holistically edited and updated where needed.
        Users will see distinctive improvements and additions in certain areas, such as a new
        section on group work and greatly expanded coverage of stress, social media, and wellbeing.</p>
    <p> While some content was removed in creating this derivative, our open
        license and platform allow instructors and students to reliably utilize content from the
        original <em>College Success</em> text. As with all of our
        books, instructors can link to individual textbook sections or utilize the various means of
        customization.</p>
    <p><em>College Success Concise</em> shares the vision and approach
        of the original textbook, and is rooted in core values of motivation, growth mindset,
        student support, and equity. The material highlights resources available to students as they
        embark on new roads of independence and responsibility. Within the chapters, students are
        given the opportunity to engage in self-analysis and reflection in order to understand their
        strengths, challenges, and aptitudes. Faculty and students will see the following consistent
        themes and approaches:</p>
    <p><em>Student engagement and self-analysis</em> are reflected in
        each section through applications and activities.</p>
    <p><em>The diversity and intersectionality of students</em> were
        considered in every example, context, and application, and the text's active surveys and
        detailed profiles make student voices a key element of the reading.</p>
    <p><em>Interconnected topics</em> are acknowledged and built upon,
        demonstrating that no element of college learning and growth occurs in isolation. The result
        is a cumulative, more complete understanding, which better prepares students to meet the
        multi-dimensional challenges of higher education.</p>
    <p><em>Openly licensed and free in all digital formats</em>, the text
        provides unparalleled flexibility in its use, customization, and accessibility for faculty
        and students. The book is provided at no cost in online, PDF, and other formats. It is also
        available in print for a very low price.</p>
    <p><em>Robust instructor ancillaries</em> will support faculty and
        course designers with teaching notes, additional exercises, worksheet versions of the
        in-text activities, lecture slides, and assessment items.</p>

      <title>Features</title>
      <p>
        <ul xml:id="m00044-eip-418">
          <li>
            <p><em>Student Profiles:</em> The voices of real students
            inform every chapter. These students grapple with the same concepts, from improving
            study skills to embracing diversity, and through their experiences and successes we
            share important stories.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Get Connected:</em> Apps, websites and tech
            opportunities that our experts recommend to help students better face the challenges of
            college and life beyond the classroom.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Analysis and Applications:</em> Peppered through every
            chapter are opportunities for students to reflect on concepts, try out processes, and
            apply what they're learning.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Student Surveys:</em> Chapters begin with a survey,
            posing questions that will get readers engaged in considering their own level of
            connection and understanding of the chapter's concept, from time management to personal
            finance to career planning.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="m00044-eip-106">
      <title>Estimated Module Completion Time </title>
      <p> Each section of <em>College Success Concise</em>
          includes an estimate of the average time needed to read through the material and work on
          the activities and applications. Each student will engage the material differently, and
          faculty will likely prioritize or assign certain components over others. As a result, the
          actual time students spend will vary greatly. OpenStax will periodically update these
          estimates based on user feedback.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="m00044-sect-00001">
      <title>Answers to Questions in the Book</title>
      <p>Answers to "Questions to Consider" questions are not provided to
          students due to the high variability of responses. The Instructor's Manual on the
          Instructor Resources page provides additional insight to assist in discussion about these
          questions. There is also a Test Bank of questions and answers only available to the
          instructor.</p>

    <title>Additional Resources</title>
    <subsection xml:id="m00044-eip-858">
      <title>Student and Instructor Resources</title>
      <p> We've compiled additional resources for both students and instructors,
          including Getting Started Guides, lecture slides, and a Test Bank.</p>
      <p>The most robust of these is the Instructor Resource Manual, developed by
          author Amy Baldwin based on extensive experience and requests from faculty reviewers and
          survey respondents. For each chapter, the IRM will contain:</p>
      <p>
        <ul xml:id="m00044-eip-911">
          <li>
            <p>Detailed teaching suggestions</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Bloom's Taxonomy matrix, indicating the alignment of each chapter activity and
            application to the level of Bloom's it fulfills.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Overarching “big picture” questions from the chapter</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Topical and cumulative case scenario activities, which present a realistic situation
            based on the concepts, and ask students to respond via writing or another method. These
            may be adapted and assigned by instructors. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Instructor resources require a verified instructor account, which you can
          apply for when you log in or create your account on OpenStax.org. Instructor and student
          resources are typically available within a few months after the book's initial
          publication. Take advantage of these resources to supplement your OpenStax book.</p>

          instructors to share community-created resources that support OpenStax books, free of
          charge. Through our Community Hubs, instructors can upload their own materials or download
          resources to use in their own courses, including additional ancillaries, teaching
          material, multimedia, and relevant course content. We encourage instructors to join the
