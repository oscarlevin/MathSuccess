    <title>About <em>College Success</em></title>
    <p><em>College Success</em> is designed to meet the course needs of a one-semester course, workshop, or seminar for first year experience or college transition students. FYE programs vary greatly according to institution, so the textbook has been developed to cover the most common concepts, and the open license and flexible formats provide many opportunities for coordinators, instructional designers, and faculty to tailor the material for their needs.
	</p>
    <p>
		This book is an invitation—an invitation to students to step boldly into their college experience. <em>College Success</em> addresses the evolving challenges and opportunities of today’s diverse students. The intensive development work leveraged expertise from hundreds of FYE coordinators and faculty across the country. It highlights resources available to students as they embark on new roads of independence and responsibility. Students engage in careful self-analysis and research-based strategies to identify their strengths, challenges, and aptitudes. While they explore study skills and learning methods, they are continually asked to apply the concepts in reading, writing, and thinking exercises, which build both a solid base for classroom discussion and a portfolio they can augment throughout their college career. Recognizing the ubiquity of technology and social media, the authors address relevant information and advice where appropriate throughout the text. The material is rooted in motivation, growth-mindset, and resilience; student readers will feel seen and involved as they continually encounter one of the textbook’s core themes: “real-life” doesn’t stop when college starts.
	</p>
    <p><em>Student engagement and self-analysis</em> are reflected in each section through applications and activities. Student reflection and opinions can be captured directly in the text, online, or in worksheets provided through the ancillary package.
	</p>
    <p><em>The diversity and intersectionality of students</em> was considered in every example, context, and application, and the text’s active surveys and detailed profiles make student voices a key element of the reading.
	</p>
    <p><em>Interconnected topics</em> are acknowledged and built upon, demonstrating that no element of college learning and growth occurs in isolation. The result is a cumulative, more complete understanding, which better prepares students to meet the multi-dimensional challenges of higher education.
	</p>
    <p><em>Openly licensed and free in all digital formats</em>, the text provides unparalleled flexibility in its use, customization, and accessibility for faculty and students. The book is provided at no cost in online, PDF, and other formats. It is also available in print for a very low price.
	</p>
    <p><em>Robust instructor ancillaries</em> will support faculty and course designers with teaching notes, additional exercises, worksheet versions of the in-text activities, lecture slides, and assessment items.

    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="m79844-eip-343">
      <title>Student Surveys and Results</title>
      <p>
Chapters begin and end with a survey, posing questions that will get readers engaged in considering their own level of connection and understanding of the chapter’s concept, from time management to personal finance to career planning. The close of each chapter revisits the survey, helping students gauge how their understanding has evolved.
</p>
      <p>
Student survey results are gathered anonymously and will be regularly provided to adopters as part of the instructor resources. (See below for more information on instructor resources.) In the future, the surveys will be assignable and the results viewable on an individual-course basis. For the survey results featured in the textbook, hundreds of students from a diverse array of colleges and universities provided their feedback to inform future students taking the course.
</p>

    <subsection xml:id="m79844-eip-106">
      <title>Estimated Module Completion Time </title>
      <p>
Each section of College Success includes an estimate of the average time needed to read through the material, work on the activities and applications, and—where necessary—explore external websites or watch videos. Each student will engage the material differently, and faculty will likely prioritize or assign certain components over others. As a result, the actual time students spend will vary greatly. OpenStax will periodically update these estimates based on user feedback. As with all other elements of the text, these estimates may be adjusted by instructors (or deleted completely) based on addition or removal of material or activities.
</p>

      <title>Answers to Questions in the Book</title>
      <p>Answers to Questions to Consider questions are not provided to students due to the high variability of responses. The Instructor's Manual on the Instructor Resources page provides additional insight to assist in discussion about these questions. There is also a Test Bank of questions and answers only available to the instructor.</p>

    <title>Additional Resources</title>
    <subsection xml:id="m79844-eip-858">
      <title>Student and Instructor Resources</title>
      <p>
We’ve compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, lecture slides, and a Test Bank.
</p>
      <p>The most robust of these is the Instructor Resource Manual, developed by author Amy Baldwin based on extensive experience and requests from faculty reviewers and survey respondents. For each chapter, the IRM will contain:</p>
      <p>
        <ul xml:id="m79844-eip-911">
          <li>
            <p>Detailed teaching suggestions</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Bloom’s Taxonomy matrix, indicating the alignment of each chapter activity and application to the level of Bloom’s it fulfills.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Overarching “big picture” questions from the chapter</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Topical and cumulative case scenario activities, which present a realistic situation based on the concepts, and ask students to respond via writing or another method. These may be adapted and assigned by instructors. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Instructor resources require a verified instructor account, which you can apply for when you log in or create your account onOpenStax.org. Instructor and student resources are typically available within a few months after the book’s initial publication. Take advantage of these resources to supplement your OpenStax book.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="m79844-eip-600">
      <title>Community Hubs</title>
      <p>
OpenStax partners with the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME) to offer Community Hubs on OER Commons—a platform for instructors to share community-created resources that support OpenStax books, free of charge. Through our Community Hubs, instructors can upload their own materials or download resources to use in their own courses, including additional ancillaries, teaching material, multimedia, and relevant course content. We encourage instructors to join the hubs for the subjects most relevant to your teaching and research as an opportunity both to enrich your courses and to engage with other faculty.
