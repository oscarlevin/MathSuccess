It comes with its own language and customs, some of which can be confusing or confounding at first. Just like traveling to a foreign country, it is best if you prepare by learning what words mean and what you are expected to say and do in certain situations.</div> <div class="para" id="p-41">Let’s first start with the language you may encounter. In most cases, there will be words that you have heard before, but they may have different meanings in a college setting. Take, for instance, “student hours” which are also commonly called “office hours”. If you are not in college, you might think that “office hours” means the hours of a day that an office is open. If it is your dentist’s office, it may mean Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. In college, “student/office hours” can refer to the specific hours a professor is in her office to meet with students, and those hours may be only a few each day: for example, Mondays and Wednesdays from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m.</div> <div class="para" id="p-42">“Syllabus” is another word that you may not have encountered, but it is one you will soon know very well. A syllabus is often called the “contract of the course” because it contains information about what to expect—from the professor and the student. It is meant to be a roadmap for succeeding in the class. Understanding that student/office hours are for you to ask your professor questions and the syllabus is the guide for what you will be doing in the class can make a big difference in your transition to college. The table on Common <dfn class="terminology">College Terms</dfn>, below, has a brief list of other words that you will want to know when you hear them on campus (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/m00004-ch01tab07.html" title="Table 1.1.1: Common College Terms, What They Mean, and Why You Need to Know">Table 1.1.1</a>).</div> <figure class="table table-like" id="m00004-ch01tab07"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.1.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Common College Terms, What They Mean, and Why You Need to Know</figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">

In addition to teaching, they may also conduct research, mentor graduate students, write and review research articles, serve on and lead campus committees, serve in regional and national organizations in their disciplines, apply for and administer grants, advise students in their major, and serve as sponsors for student organizations.

These relationships are important because they will allow you to expand your network, especially as it relates to your career. As stated earlier, developing relationships with faculty can provide you with more than just the benefits of a mentor.

<em class="emphasis">Prevailing Opinions</em>. Simply put, you are going to encounter instructors and learning activities that you sometimes agree with and sometimes do not. The key is to learn from them regardless. In either case, take ownership of your learning and even make an effort to learn about other perspectives, even if it is only for your own education on the matter. There is no better time to expose yourself to other opinions and philosophies than in college. In fact, many would say that this is a significant part of the college experience. With the right mindset, it is easy to view everything as a learning opportunity.</div> <div class="para" id="p-115">
<em class="emphasis">Classroom Circumstances.</em> These kinds of circumstances often require a more structured approach to turn the situation to your advantage, but they also usually have the most obvious solutions. In a large class, you might find yourself limited in the ability to participate in classroom discussions because of so many other students. The way around that would be to speak to several classmates and create your own discussion group. You could set up a time to meet, or you could take a different route by using technology such as an online discussion board, a Zoom session, or even a group text. Several of the technologically-based solutions might even be better than an in-class discussion since you do not all have to be present at the same time. The discussion can be something that occurs all week long, giving everyone the time to think through their ideas and responses.</div> <div class="para" id="p-116">Again, the main point is to first spot those things in the hidden curriculum that might put your learning at a disadvantage and devise a solution that either reduces the negative impact or even becomes a learning advantage.</div> </section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-4"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">What to Expect During the First Year.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-117">While you may not experience every transition within your first year, there are rhythms to each semester of the first year and each year you are in college.

You may find that the courses and assignments do not seem much different than they did in high school (more on that later), but you may be in for a shock when you get your graded tests and papers. Many new college students find that their first grades are lower than they expected. For some students, this may mean they have earned a B when they are used to earning As, but for many students, it means they may experience their first <em class="emphasis">failing or almost-failing grades</em> in college because they have not used active, effective study strategies; instead, they studied how they did in high school, which is often insufficient. This can be a shock if you are not prepared, but it doesn’t have to devastate you if you are willing to use it as a wake-up call to do something different.</div> <div class="para" id="p-135">By the middle of the semester, you’ll likely feel much more confident and a little more relaxed. Your grades are improving because you started tutoring and using better study strategies. You are looking ahead, even beyond the first semester, to start planning your courses for the next term. If you are working while in college, you may also find that you have a rhythm down for balancing it all; additionally, your time management skills have likely improved.</div> <div class="para" id="p-136">By the last few weeks of the semester, you will be focused on the increasing importance of your assignments and upcoming finals and trying to figure out how to juggle that with the family obligations of the impending holidays. You may feel a little more pressure to prepare for finals, as this time is often viewed as the most stressful period of the semester. All of this additional workload and need to plan for the next semester can seem overwhelming, but if you plan ahead and use what you learn from this chapter and the rest of the course, you will be able to get through it more easily.</div> </section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-5"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Don’t Do It Alone.</span></h3> <div class="para" id="p-137">Think about our earlier descriptions of two students, Reginald and Madison. What if they found that the first few weeks were a little harder than they had anticipated? Should they have given up and dropped out? Or should they have talked to someone about their struggles? Here is a secret about college success that not many people know: successful students seek help. They use resources. And they do that as often as necessary to get what they need. Your professors and advisors will expect the same from you, and your college will have all kinds of offices, staff, and programs that are designed to help. This bears calling out again: <em class="emphasis">you need to use those resources</em>. These are called “help-seeking behaviors,” and along with self-advocacy, which is speaking up for your needs, they are essential to your success. As you get more comfortable adjusting to life in college, you will find that asking for help is easier. In fact, you may become really good at it by the time you graduate, just in time for you to ask for help finding a job! Review the table on Issues, Campus Resources, and Potential Outcomes for a few examples of times you may need to ask for help. See if you can identify where on campus you can find the same or a similar resource.</div> <figure class="table table-like" id="m00004-ch01tab13"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.1.6<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Issues, Campus Resources, and Potential Outcomes</figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">

If you experience any—or even all—of these, the important point here is that you are not alone and that you can overcome them by using your resources. Many college students have felt like this before, and they have survived—even thrived—despite them because they were able to identify a strategy or resource that they could use to help themselves. At some point in your academic career, you may do one or more of the following:</div> <div class="para logical" id="p-159"><ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-36"><div class="para" id="p-160">
<em class="emphasis">Feel like an imposter.</em> There is actually a name for this condition: <dfn class="terminology">imposter syndrome</dfn>. Students who feel like an imposter are worried that they don’t belong, that someone will “expose them for being a fake.” This feeling is pretty common for anyone who finds themselves in a new environment and is not sure if they have what it takes to succeed. Trust the professionals who work with first-year college students: you <span class="process-math">\(do\)</span> have what it takes, and you <em class="emphasis">will</em> succeed. Just give yourself time to get adjusted to everything.</div></li>
<li id="li-37"><div class="para" id="p-161">
<em class="emphasis">Worry about making a mistake.</em> This concern often goes with imposter syndrome. Students who worry about making a mistake don’t like to answer questions in class, volunteer for a challenging assignment, and even ask for help from others. Instead of avoiding situations where you may fail, embrace the process of learning, which includes—is even dependent on—making mistakes. The more you practice courage in these situations and focus on what you are going to learn from failing, the more confident you become about your abilities.</div></li>
<li id="li-38"><div class="para" id="p-162">
<em class="emphasis">Try to manage everything yourself.</em> Even superheroes need help from sidekicks and mere mortals. Trying to handle everything on your own every time an issue arises is a recipe for getting stressed out. There will be times when you are overwhelmed by all you have to do. This is when you will need to ask for and allow others to help you.</div></li>
<li id="li-39"><div class="para" id="p-163">
<em class="emphasis">Ignore your mental and physical health needs.</em> If you feel you are on an emotional rollercoaster and you cannot find time to take care of yourself, then you have most likely ignored some part of your mental and physical well-being. What you need to do to stay healthy should be non-negotiable. In other words, your sleep, eating habits, exercise, and stress-reducing activities should be your highest priorities.</div></li>
<li id="li-40"><div class="para" id="p-164">
<em class="emphasis">Forget to enjoy the experience.</em> Whether you are 18 years old and living on campus or 48 years old starting back to college after taking a break to work and raise a family, be sure to take the time to remind yourself of the joy that learning can bring.</div></li>
